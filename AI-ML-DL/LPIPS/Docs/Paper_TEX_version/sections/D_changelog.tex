\section{Changelog}
\label{sec:change}
\paragraph{v1} initial preprint release

\paragraph{v2} CVPR camera ready; moved TID results (Appendix~\ref{sec:tid}), SSIM vs BiGAN (Figure~\ref{fig:qual_comp}), and some training details into the Appendix to fit into 8 page limit; clarified that SSIM was not designed to handle geometric distortions~\cite{sampat2009complex} and clarified that our dataset is a perceptual similarity dataset (as opposed to an IQA dataset); added linear weights for \textit{Squeeze-lin} and \textit{VGG-lin} architectures in Figure~\ref{fig:weights}; miscellaneous small edits to text.
