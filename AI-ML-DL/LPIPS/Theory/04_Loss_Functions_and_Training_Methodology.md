## 1. 2AFC Loss Function Design and Derivation

### 1.1 2-Alternative Forced Choice Problem Formulation

**PROBLEM SETUP:**
Given a triplet (x_ref, x_0, x_1) where:
- x_ref: Reference image
- x_0, x_1: Two candidate images
- h ∈ {0, 1}: Human judgment (0 if x_0 chosen, 1 if x_1 chosen)

**DISTANCE COMPUTATION:**
```
d_0 = d_LPIPS(x_ref, x_0)
d_1 = d_LPIPS(x_ref, x_1)
```

**PREDICTION TASK:**
Predict human choice based on distance comparison.

### 1.2 Probabilistic Model Design

**CHOICE PROBABILITY MODEL:**
```
P(human chooses x_1) = σ(G(d_0, d_1))
```

where:
- σ(z) = 1/(1 + exp(-z)): Sigmoid function
- G(d_0, d_1): Comparison function

**COMPARISON FUNCTION OPTIONS:**

**SIMPLE DIFFERENCE:**
```
G(d_0, d_1) = d_0 - d_1
```
Interpretation: Choose option with smaller distance

**LEARNED COMPARISON:**
```
G(d_0, d_1) = MLP([d_0, d_1])
```
where MLP is a small neural network with architecture:
Input: [d_0, d_1] → FC(32) → ReLU → FC(32) → ReLU → FC(1) → Output

**RATIO-BASED COMPARISON:**
```
G(d_0, d_1) = log(d_1/d_0)
```
Interpretation: Logarithmic ratio of distances

### 1.3 Loss Function Derivation

**BINARY CROSS-ENTROPY LOSS:**
```
L(x_ref, x_0, x_1, h) = -[h × log(P(choose x_1)) + (1-h) × log(1 - P(choose x_1))]
```

**SUBSTITUTING PROBABILITY MODEL:**
```
L = -[h × log(σ(G(d_0, d_1))) + (1-h) × log(1 - σ(G(d_0, d_1)))]
```

**SIMPLIFIED FORM:**
```
L = -[h × log(σ(G)) + (1-h) × log(σ(-G))]
```

where G = G(d_0, d_1) for brevity.

**GRADIENT COMPUTATION:**
```
∂L/∂G = h × σ(-G) - (1-h) × σ(G) = h - σ(G)
```

This shows that gradient is proportional to prediction error.

### 1.4 Soft Label Extension

**HANDLING SPLIT JUDGMENTS:**
When human annotators disagree, use soft labels:
```
h = (number choosing x_1) / (total number of annotators)
```

**EXAMPLES:**
- Unanimous for x_0: h = 0.0
- Split 1-1: h = 0.5  
- Unanimous for x_1: h = 1.0
- Split 2-1 for x_1: h = 0.67

**MODIFIED LOSS:**
Same binary cross-entropy form, but h can be continuous in [0,1].

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Captures uncertainty in human judgments
- Provides richer training signal
- Reduces overfitting to noisy labels

### 1.5 Alternative Loss Functions

**HINGE LOSS:**
```
L_hinge = max(0, margin - (2×h - 1) × G(d_0, d_1))
```

where margin is a hyperparameter (typically 1.0).

**RANKING LOSS:**
```
L_rank = max(0, margin + d_0 - d_1) if h = 1
L_rank = max(0, margin + d_1 - d_0) if h = 0
```

**MSE LOSS (for continuous similarity scores):**
```
L_mse = (predicted_similarity - human_similarity)²
```

**FOCAL LOSS (for handling class imbalance):**
```
L_focal = -α × (1 - p_t)^γ × log(p_t)
```
where p_t is the predicted probability for the correct class.

## 2. Three Training Paradigms Analysis

### 2.1 Linear Calibration ("lin") Paradigm

**METHODOLOGY:**
- Freeze all pre-trained network parameters
- Learn only linear weights w_l for each layer
- Simple and fast training approach

**MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:**
```
minimize: Σᵢ L(hᵢ, f_w(d₁ᵢ, d₂ᵢ, ..., dₗᵢ))
subject to: wₗ ≥ 0 for all layers l
where: Network parameters φ are fixed
```

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Fast training: Only optimizing ~1000-5000 parameters
- Stable optimization: Convex problem when features fixed
- Good baseline: Often achieves 69-70% performance
- Interpretable: Weights show layer importance

**DISADVANTAGES:**
- Limited adaptability: Cannot modify feature extraction
- Feature dependence: Performance limited by pre-trained features
- Domain mismatch: May not adapt to new image domains

**TRAINING DETAILS:**
- Optimization: Adam with lr=1e-4
- Training time: 1-3 hours on single GPU
- Memory requirement: Low (only storing gradients for weights)
- Convergence: Typically 5-10 epochs

### 2.2 Training from Scratch ("scratch") Paradigm

**METHODOLOGY:**
- Initialize entire network randomly
- Train all parameters end-to-end
- Learn both features and similarity function

**MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:**
```
minimize: Σᵢ L(hᵢ, f_{w,θ}(x_refᵢ, x_0ᵢ, x_1ᵢ))
subject to: wₗ ≥ 0 for all layers l
where: Both network parameters θ and weights w are optimized
```

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Maximum flexibility: Can learn optimal features for task
- Best performance: Often achieves highest accuracy (~70%)
- Task-specific: Features adapted specifically for perceptual similarity
- No pre-training bias: Not limited by ImageNet classification objective

**DISADVANTAGES:**
- Slow training: 5-10x longer than linear approach
- Large dataset requirement: Needs substantial training data
- Unstable optimization: Non-convex optimization landscape
- Overfitting risk: High capacity model

**TRAINING DETAILS:**
- Optimization: Adam with lr=1e-4, weight decay=1e-4
- Training time: 2-5 days on multiple GPUs
- Memory requirement: High (storing gradients for entire network)
- Convergence: 20-50 epochs with learning rate decay

### 2.3 Fine-tuning ("tune") Paradigm

**METHODOLOGY:**
- Start with pre-trained network
- Fine-tune all parameters end-to-end
- Balance between adaptation and preservation

**MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:**
```
minimize: Σᵢ L(hᵢ, f_{w,θ}(x_refᵢ, x_0ᵢ, x_1ᵢ)) + λ × R(θ)
subject to: wₗ ≥ 0 for all layers l
where: R(θ) is regularization term
```

**ADVANTAGES:**
- Balanced approach: Combines pre-trained knowledge with adaptation
- Moderate training time: Faster than scratch, slower than linear
- Good generalization: Less overfitting than scratch
- Stable convergence: Better initialization than random

**DISADVANTAGES:**
- Hyperparameter sensitive: Learning rate and regularization critical
- Domain dependence: May inherit pre-training biases
- Intermediate performance: Often between linear and scratch
- Optimization complexity: More challenging than linear

**TRAINING DETAILS:**
- Optimization: Adam with different learning rates for backbone vs head
- Backbone lr: 1e-5 (10x smaller than head)
- Head lr: 1e-4
- Training time: 1-2 days on multiple GPUs
- Regularization: Weight decay, early stopping

### 2.4 Comparative Performance Analysis

**EMPIRICAL RESULTS:**

| Network    | Linear | Scratch | Tune  | Best Method |
|------------|--------|---------|-------|-------------|
| AlexNet    | 69.8%  | 70.2%   | 69.7% | Scratch     |
| VGG-16     | 69.2%  | 70.0%   | 69.8% | Scratch     |
| SqueezeNet | 70.0%  | 69.2%   | 69.6% | Linear      |

**ANALYSIS:**
- Scratch often achieves best performance
- Linear provides excellent efficiency-performance trade-off
- Fine-tuning shows diminishing returns
- Architecture-dependent optimal strategy

**TRAINING TIME COMPARISON:**
- Linear: 1-3 hours
- Fine-tuning: 1-2 days
- Scratch: 2-5 days

**PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Development: Start with linear for fast iteration
- Production: Use scratch for maximum performance
- Resource-constrained: Linear provides best efficiency

## 3. Optimization Constraints and Projection Methods

### 3.1 Non-negativity Constraint Motivation

**THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION:**
Non-negative weights ensure distance properties:
- Larger feature differences increase overall distance
- Intuitive: Similar features should not make images more different
- Mathematical: Maintains positive semi-definite nature

**MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:**
```
Constraint set: C = {w : wₗ ≥ 0 for all layers l, all channels}
```

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
If wₗ < 0 for some channel:
- Large feature differences would decrease total distance
- Counter-intuitive similarity behavior
- Potential instability in optimization

### 3.2 Projection Methods

**PROJECTION OPERATOR:**
```
P_C(w) = max(0, w) (element-wise)
```

**MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES:**
- Non-expansive: ||P_C(u) - P_C(v)|| ≤ ||u - v||
- Idempotent: P_C(P_C(w)) = P_C(w)
- Closed-form: Efficient computation

**PROJECTED GRADIENT DESCENT:**
```
w^(t+1) = P_C(w^t - η × ∇L(w^t))
```

**ALGORITHM:**
1. Compute gradient: g = ∇L(w^t)
2. Take gradient step: w_temp = w^t - η × g
3. Project onto constraints: w^(t+1) = max(0, w_temp)

### 3.3 Alternative Constraint Handling

**BARRIER METHODS:**
Add log-barrier to objective:
```
L_barrier(w) = L(w) - μ × Σₗ Σc log(w_{l,c})
```

As μ → 0, solution approaches constrained optimum.

**PENALTY METHODS:**
Add penalty for constraint violations:
```
L_penalty(w) = L(w) + ρ × Σₗ Σc max(0, -w_{l,c})²
```

**AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN:**
Combine Lagrangian and penalty:
```
L_aug(w, λ) = L(w) + λᵀh(w) + (ρ/2)||h(w)||²
```
where h(w) represents constraint violations.

**PRACTICAL COMPARISON:**
- Projection: Simple, exact constraint satisfaction
- Barrier: Smooth but approximate
- Penalty: Simple but may violate constraints during training

## 4. Learning Rate Schedules and Hyperparameter Selection

### 4.1 Learning Rate Schedule Design

**CONSTANT LEARNING RATE:**
```
η_t = η_0 for all t
```

**STEP DECAY:**
```
η_t = η_0 × γ^floor(t/step_size)
```
Typical: γ = 0.1, step_size = 10 epochs

**LINEAR DECAY:**
```
η_t = η_0 × (1 - t/T)
```
where T is total training steps.

**COSINE ANNEALING:**
```
η_t = η_min + (η_max - η_min) × (1 + cos(π × t/T)) / 2
```

**EXPONENTIAL DECAY:**
```
η_t = η_0 × exp(-decay_rate × t)
```

### 4.2 Architecture-Specific Recommendations

**LINEAR TRAINING:**
- Initial learning rate: 1e-4
- Schedule: Linear decay over 10 epochs
- Warmup: 1-2 epochs with lower lr
- Final lr: 1e-6

**SCRATCH TRAINING:**
- Initial learning rate: 1e-4 to 1e-3
- Schedule: Step decay at epochs 15, 25, 35
- Warmup: 5 epochs with gradual increase
- Weight decay: 1e-4

**FINE-TUNING:**
- Backbone lr: 1e-5 (pre-trained features)
- Head lr: 1e-4 (new weights)
- Schedule: Cosine annealing
- Warmup: 2-3 epochs

### 4.3 Adaptive Learning Rate Methods

**ADAM OPTIMIZER:**
```
m_t = β₁ × m_{t-1} + (1 - β₁) × g_t
v_t = β₂ × v_{t-1} + (1 - β₂) × g_t²
w_{t+1} = w_t - η × m̂_t / (√v̂_t + ε)
```

where m̂_t and v̂_t are bias-corrected estimates.

**RMSPROP:**
```
v_t = β × v_{t-1} + (1 - β) × g_t²
w_{t+1} = w_t - η × g_t / (√v_t + ε)
```

**ADAGRAD:**
```
v_t = v_{t-1} + g_t²
w_{t+1} = w_t - η × g_t / (√v_t + ε)
```

**PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Adam: Most robust, good default choice
- RMSprop: Good for non-stationary objectives
- AdaGrad: Good for sparse gradients
- SGD with momentum: Simple, often competitive

### 4.4 Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis

**LEARNING RATE SENSITIVITY:**
- Too high: Unstable training, oscillations
- Too low: Slow convergence, poor final performance
- Optimal range: 1e-5 to 1e-3 depending on method

**BATCH SIZE EFFECTS:**
- Small batches (16-32): Noisy gradients, better generalization
- Large batches (128-256): Stable gradients, faster training
- Very large batches (>512): May need learning rate scaling

**WEIGHT DECAY IMPACT:**
- No weight decay: Potential overfitting
- Too much weight decay: Underfitting, slow learning
- Optimal range: 1e-5 to 1e-3

**EMPIRICAL GUIDELINES:**
1. Start with Adam optimizer, lr=1e-4
2. Use linear warmup for 2-5 epochs
3. Apply step decay or cosine annealing
4. Tune weight decay based on validation performance
5. Use early stopping based on validation loss

## 5. Regularization Strategies and Constraint Enforcement

### 5.1 Weight Regularization Techniques

**L2 REGULARIZATION (Weight Decay):**
```
R(w) = λ × Σₗ ||wₗ||₂²
```

Encourages small weights, prevents overfitting.

**L1 REGULARIZATION:**
```
R(w) = λ × Σₗ ||wₗ||₁
```

Encourages sparsity, automatic feature selection.

**ELASTIC NET:**
```
R(w) = λ₁ × ||w||₁ + λ₂ × ||w||₂²
```

Combines L1 and L2 benefits.

**GROUP LASSO:**
```
R(w) = Σₗ √(||wₗ||₂²)
```

Encourages group-wise sparsity across layers.

### 5.2 Constraint-Specific Regularization

**SOFT NON-NEGATIVITY:**
```
R(w) = λ × Σₗ Σc max(0, -w_{l,c})²
```

Penalizes negative weights without hard constraints.

**SIMPLEX REGULARIZATION:**
```
R(w) = λ × ||Σₗ wₗ - 1||²
```

Encourages weights to sum to 1 across layers.

**ENTROPY REGULARIZATION:**
```
R(w) = -λ × Σₗ wₗ × log(wₗ)
```

Encourages uniform weight distribution.

### 5.3 Data Augmentation

**GEOMETRIC AUGMENTATIONS:**
- Random crops: 224×224 from larger images
- Horizontal flips: 50% probability
- Small rotations: ±5 degrees
- Color jittering: Brightness, contrast, saturation

**CONSISTENCY REGULARIZATION:**
Apply same augmentation to all images in triplet:
```
L_consistency = L(h, f(aug(x_ref), aug(x_0), aug(x_1)))
```

**MIXUP AUGMENTATION:**
Create virtual triplets by mixing existing ones:
```
x_mixed = α × x₁ + (1-α) × x₂
h_mixed = α × h₁ + (1-α) × h₂
```

### 5.4 Dropout and Noise Injection

**FEATURE DROPOUT:**
Randomly zero out feature channels during training:
```
φ_dropout = φ × bernoulli(p) / p
```

**GAUSSIAN NOISE:**
Add noise to features:
```
φ_noisy = φ + ε, ε ~ N(0, σ²)
```

**LABEL SMOOTHING:**
Smooth hard labels:
```
h_smooth = h × (1 - α) + 0.5 × α
```

where α is smoothing parameter.

## 6. Gradient Analysis and Backpropagation

### 6.1 Loss Gradient Computation

**CHAIN RULE APPLICATION:**
```
∂L/∂wₗ = ∂L/∂d_total × ∂d_total/∂dₗ × ∂dₗ/∂wₗ
```

**GRADIENT COMPONENTS:**

1. **Loss to total distance:**
   ```
   ∂L/∂d_total = ∂L/∂G × ∂G/∂d_total
   ```

2. **Total distance to layer distance:**
   ```
   ∂d_total/∂dₗ = αₗ (for linear aggregation)
   ```

3. **Layer distance to weights:**
   ```
   ∂dₗ/∂wₗ = (1/(Hₗ × Wₗ)) × Σₕ,w (φₗʰ'ʷ(x₀) - φₗʰ'ʷ(x₁))²
   ```

### 6.2 Feature Gradient Computation

For end-to-end training, gradients flow back to features:
```
∂L/∂φₗʰ'ʷ = ∂L/∂dₗ × ∂dₗ/∂φₗʰ'ʷ
```

**NORMALIZED FEATURE GRADIENTS:**
When features are normalized, gradient computation becomes more complex:
```
∂φ_norm/∂φ = (I - φ_norm × φ_normᵀ) / ||φ||
```

where I is identity matrix.

### 6.3 Numerical Stability

**GRADIENT CLIPPING:**
Clip gradients to prevent explosion:
```
g_clipped = g × min(1, threshold / ||g||)
```

**GRADIENT NORMALIZATION:**
Normalize gradients across layers:
```
gₗ_normalized = gₗ / √(Σₗ ||gₗ||²)
```

**NUMERICAL PRECISION:**
- Use float32 for efficiency
- Consider float64 for numerical experiments
- Monitor gradient magnitudes for instability

### 6.4 Gradient Flow Analysis

**VANISHING GRADIENTS:**
Check gradient magnitudes across layers:
If ||∂L/∂w_early|| << ||∂L/∂w_late||, vanishing gradient problem.

**SOLUTIONS:**
- Skip connections in comparison network
- Careful weight initialization
- Gradient clipping
- Learning rate adjustment

**EXPLODING GRADIENTS:**
Check for exponentially growing gradients:
If ||∂L/∂w|| >> 1, exploding gradient problem.

**SOLUTIONS:**
- Gradient clipping
- Smaller learning rates
- Better weight initialization
- Batch normalization
