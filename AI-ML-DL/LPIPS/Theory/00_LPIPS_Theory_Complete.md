## 1. Introduction and Motivation

### 1.1 The Perceptual Similarity Problem

**Core Challenge**: How do we measure image similarity in a way that matches human visual perception?

Traditional pixel-wise metrics like L1, L2, and PSNR fail catastrophically at capturing perceptual similarity:
- **Spatial Independence Assumption**: Treat each pixel independently
- **Linear Assumption**: Small pixel changes = small perceptual changes (often false)
- **Context Ignorance**: Don't consider surrounding pixels or high-level structure

### 1.2 Historical Context

**Evolution of Perceptual Metrics**:
```
Pixel-wise (L1, L2, PSNR) → Structural (SSIM, FSIM) → Feature-based (LPIPS)
```

**Limitations of Previous Approaches**:
- **SSIM**: Good for structural similarity but fails with geometric distortions
- **FSIM**: Uses phase congruency but limited by hand-crafted features
- **MS-SSIM**: Multi-scale SSIM but still structurally limited

### 1.3 Deep Learning Revolution

**Key Insight**: Features learned by CNNs for high-level tasks (like classification) contain rich perceptual information that can be repurposed for similarity measurement.

**Emergence Property**: Perceptual similarity appears to be an emergent property across different:
- Network architectures (VGG, AlexNet, ResNet)
- Training objectives (supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised)
- Training datasets (ImageNet, other domains)

---

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Perceptual Representation Theory

**Hypothesis**: Deep networks learn hierarchical representations that mirror human visual processing:

```
Low-level features (edges, textures) → Mid-level (patterns, shapes) → High-level (objects, semantics)
```

### 2.2 Feature Space Geometry

**Core Principle**: In deep feature space, perceptually similar images cluster together, while perceptually different images are farther apart.

**Mathematical Intuition**:
- Let φ(x) be the feature representation of image x
- Perceptual distance: d(x₁, x₂) = f(φ(x₁), φ(x₂))
- Where f is a distance function in feature space

### 2.3 Transfer Learning for Perception

**Key Discovery**: Features trained for object recognition transfer remarkably well to perceptual similarity tasks.

**Theoretical Justification**:
1. **Hierarchical Processing**: Both tasks require understanding visual hierarchy
2. **Invariance Learning**: Classification networks learn invariances that align with human perception
3. **Representation Richness**: High-capacity networks capture diverse visual patterns

---

## 3. Mathematical Formulation

### 3.1 Basic LPIPS Formula

For two images x₀ and x₁, LPIPS distance is computed as:

```
d(x₀, x₁) = Σₗ (1/Hₗ×Wₗ) Σₕ,w ||wₗ ⊙ (φₗ^(h,w)(x₀) - φₗ^(h,w)(x₁))||₂²
```

Where:
- φₗ^(h,w)(x): Feature activation at layer l, spatial location (h,w)
- wₗ: Learned linear weights for layer l
- Hₗ, Wₗ: Height and width of feature map at layer l
- ⊙: Element-wise multiplication

### 3.2 Layer-wise Feature Extraction

**Multi-layer Aggregation**:
```python
# Pseudo-code for feature extraction
features = []
for layer in [conv1, conv2, conv3, conv4, conv5]:
    feat = layer(image)
    feat_normalized = feat / ||feat||₂  # Unit normalize
    features.append(feat_normalized)
```

### 3.3 Linear Calibration

**Objective Function** for learning weights:
```
L(x, x₀, x₁, h) = -h log G(d(x,x₀), d(x,x₁)) - (1-h) log(1 - G(d(x,x₀), d(x,x₁)))
```

Where:
- G: Small neural network (2 FC layers + sigmoid)
- h: Human judgment (0 or 1, or soft labels for split judgments)
- d(x,x₀), d(x,x₁): Distances to reference patches

### 3.4 Weight Learning Network Architecture

```
Input: [d(x,x₀), d(x,x₁)] → FC(32) → ReLU → FC(32) → ReLU → FC(1) → Sigmoid → Output
```

**Constraints**:
- Weights wₗ ≥ 0 (non-negative constraint)
- Projection at each iteration: w ← max(0, w)

## 4. Network Architectures

### 4.1 Supported Backbones

**Primary Architectures**:

#### 4.1.1 AlexNet
```
Layers used: conv1, conv2, conv3, conv4, conv5
Advantages: Lightweight, fast computation

```

#### 4.1.2 VGG-16
```
Layers used: conv1_2, conv2_2, conv3_3, conv4_3, conv5_3

#### 4.1.3 SqueezeNet
```
Layers used: Similar depth to AlexNet but more efficient
Advantages: Smallest model size

```

### 4.2 Feature Extraction Points

**Strategic Layer Selection**:
- **Early layers**: Capture low-level features (edges, textures)
- **Middle layers**: Capture mid-level patterns
- **Later layers**: Capture high-level semantic information

**Empirical Finding**: Using multiple layers gives better performance than any single layer.

### 4.3 Self-Supervised and Unsupervised Variants

**Surprising Discovery**: Networks trained without labels still perform well:

```
BiGAN (self-supervised): 68.4% accuracy
Split-Brain (self-supervised): 67.5% accuracy
Puzzle solving (self-supervised): 68.1% accuracy
K-means clustering (unsupervised): Beats traditional metrics
```

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Preprocessing Pipeline

```python
def preprocess_image(image):
    """
    Standard LPIPS preprocessing
    """
    # Resize to standard size (typically 64x64 for patches)
    image = resize(image, (64, 64))
    
    # Convert to tensor and normalize to [-1, 1]
    image = torch.tensor(image).float()
    image = (image / 127.5) - 1.0
    
    return image
```

### 6.2 Feature Normalization

**Unit Normalization** (Critical Component):
```python
def normalize_features(features):
    """
    L2 normalize features along channel dimension
    """
    norm = torch.norm(features, dim=1, keepdim=True)
    return features / (norm + 1e-10)
```

**Why Normalization Matters**:
- Removes magnitude effects
- Focuses on feature direction/pattern
- Improves cross-layer compatibility

### 6.3 Distance Computation

```python
def compute_layer_distance(feat1, feat2, weights):
    """
    Compute weighted distance for single layer
    """
    # Element-wise difference
    diff = feat1 - feat2
    
    # Apply learned weights
    weighted_diff = weights * diff
    
    # L2 norm and spatial averaging
    dist = torch.norm(weighted_diff, dim=1)  # Per spatial location
    return torch.mean(dist)  # Average over spatial dimensions
```

### 6.4 Multi-layer Aggregation

```python
def compute_lpips_distance(image1, image2, model):
    """
    Full LPIPS distance computation
    """
    total_distance = 0.0
    
    # Extract features from all layers
    features1 = model.extract_features(image1)
    features2 = model.extract_features(image2)
    
    # Aggregate across layers
    for layer_name in model.layer_names:
        feat1 = features1[layer_name]
        feat2 = features2[layer_name]
        weights = model.learned_weights[layer_name]
        
        layer_dist = compute_layer_distance(feat1, feat2, weights)
        total_distance += layer_dist
    
    return total_distance
```

## 7. Evaluation Metrics

### 7.1 2-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC)

**Primary Evaluation Method**:
```
Given: Reference image x, and two candidates x₀, x₁
Task: Determine which candidate is more similar to reference
Metric: Percentage of correct human judgments matched
```

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
Accuracy = (Number of correct predictions) / (Total number of judgments)

Correct prediction: argmin(d(x,x₀), d(x,x₁)) matches human choice
```

### 7.2 Just Noticeable Difference (JND)

**Threshold Analysis**:
```python
def compute_jnd_threshold(metric, human_judgments):
    """
    Find threshold where metric matches human detection
    """
    thresholds = np.linspace(0, max_distance, 100)
    accuracies = []
    
    for threshold in thresholds:
        predictions = metric_distances > threshold
        accuracy = np.mean(predictions == human_judgments)
        accuracies.append(accuracy)
    
    return thresholds[np.argmax(accuracies)]
```

### 7.3 Correlation Analysis

**Pearson and Spearman Correlation**:
```python
# Correlation with human similarity ratings
pearson_corr = np.corrcoef(metric_scores, human_scores)[0,1]
spearman_corr = scipy.stats.spearmanr(metric_scores, human_scores)[0]
```
