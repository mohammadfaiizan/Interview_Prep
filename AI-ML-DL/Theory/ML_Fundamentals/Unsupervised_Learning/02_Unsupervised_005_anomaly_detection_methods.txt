1. ANOMALY DETECTION FUNDAMENTALS
=================================

1.1 Definition and Types:
------------------------
Anomaly (Outlier): Data point that deviates significantly from normal behavior

Types of Anomalies:

Point Anomalies:
Individual data points are anomalous
Example: Credit card transaction with unusual amount

Contextual Anomalies:
Data point is anomalous in specific context
Example: High temperature in winter

Collective Anomalies:
Collection of data points is anomalous
Example: DDoS attack (individual requests normal, pattern abnormal)

1.2 Problem Categories:
----------------------
Supervised Anomaly Detection:
- Training data has labeled normal/anomaly examples
- Binary classification problem
- Challenge: Highly imbalanced classes

Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection:
- Training data has only normal examples
- Learn model of normality
- Most common approach

Unsupervised Anomaly Detection:
- No labeled data available
- Assume anomalies are rare and different
- Statistical or distance-based approaches

1.3 Challenges:
--------------
Class Imbalance:
Anomalies are typically rare (< 1% of data)
Standard classifiers may ignore minority class

High Dimensionality:
Curse of dimensionality affects distance metrics

1.5 Evaluation Challenges:
-------------------------
Labeled Data Scarcity:
Limited ground truth for evaluation
Expensive to obtain expert annotations

Performance Metrics:
Standard accuracy misleading due to imbalance
Need specialized metrics (precision, recall, F1)

Temporal Aspects:
Performance may vary over time
Need to evaluate on temporal data

False Positive Cost:
Cost of false alarms vs missed detections
Domain-specific trade-offs

=======================================================

2. STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTION
================================

2.1 Univariate Statistical Methods:
----------------------------------
Z-Score (Standard Score):
z = (x - μ) / σ

Threshold: |z| > k (typically k = 2 or 3)
Assumes normal distribution

Modified Z-Score:
z_modified = 0.6745 × (x - median) / MAD

where MAD = median(|x_i - median(x)|)
More robust to outliers

Grubbs' Test:
G = max |x_i - x̄| / s

Critical values from Grubbs' distribution
Tests for single outlier

Dixon's Q Test:
Q = gap / range

For ordered data: x₁ ≤ x₂ ≤ ... ≤ xₙ
Tests extreme values

2.2 Multivariate Statistical Methods:
------------------------------------
Mahalanobis Distance:
D² = (x - μ)ᵀ Σ⁻¹ (x - μ)

Accounts for correlations between variables
Threshold using chi-square distribution

Hotelling's T² Test:
T² = n(x̄ - μ₀)ᵀ S⁻¹ (x̄ - μ₀)

For testing if sample mean differs from hypothesized mean
Multivariate extension of t-test

Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD):
Robust estimation of location and scatter
Less influenced by outliers
Use robust estimates for Mahalanobis distance

2.3 Distribution-Based Methods:
------------------------------
Gaussian Model:
Assume data follows multivariate normal distribution
p(x) = (2π)^(-d/2) |Σ|^(-1/2) exp(-½(x-μ)ᵀΣ⁻¹(x-μ))

Anomaly if p(x) < threshold

Mixture Models:
Model normal data as mixture of Gaussians
p(x) = Σₖ πₖ N(x; μₖ, Σₖ)

Use EM algorithm for parameter estimation

Extreme Value Theory:
Model tail behavior of distributions
Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution
Block maxima or peaks-over-threshold approaches

2.4 Non-parametric Methods:
--------------------------
Histogram-Based:
Build histogram of normal data
Anomaly if data falls in low-frequency bins

Kernel Density Estimation:
p̂(x) = (1/nh) Σᵢ K((x-xᵢ)/h)

Anomaly if p̂(x) < threshold
Bandwidth selection critical

Empirical Cumulative Distribution:
Use empirical CDF to define normal range
Anomaly if outside typical quantiles

2.5 Time Series Anomaly Detection:

=======================================================

3. DISTANCE-BASED METHODS
=========================

3.1 k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):
------------------------------
Distance to k-th Nearest Neighbor:
d_k(x) = distance to k-th nearest neighbor of x

Anomaly if d_k(x) > threshold

Average k-NN Distance:
d̄_k(x) = (1/k) Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ d_i(x)

where d_i(x) is distance to i-th nearest neighbor

Relative Density:
Compare local density to neighborhood density
Account for varying data density

3.2 Local Outlier Factor (LOF):
------------------------------
Local Reachability Density:
lrd_k(x) = 1 / (Σᵢ∈N_k(x) reach_dist_k(x,i) / |N_k(x)|)

Reachability Distance:
reach_dist_k(x,y) = max{k-distance(y), d(x,y)}

Local Outlier Factor:
LOF_k(x) = (Σᵢ∈N_k(x) lrd_k(i) / |N_k(x)|) / lrd_k(x)

Interpretation:
- LOF ≈ 1: Normal point
- LOF >> 1: Outlier

3.3 Connectivity-Based Outlier Factor (COF):

More robust to parameter selection

Cost-based connectivity:
Consider path costs in neighborhood graph

3.4 Influenced Outlierness (INFLO):
----------------------------------
Influenced set: union of k-NN and reverse k-NN
More stable than LOF
Better handling of boundary points

INFLO_k(x) = |IS_k(x)| / Σᵢ∈IS_k(x) den_k(i) × den_k(x)

3.5 Distance-Based Outliers:
----------------------------

DB(r,π) Outliers:
Point is outlier if at least π fraction of points are distance r away

Advantages:
- Simple and intuitive
- Parameter has clear meaning
- Works for arbitrary distance metrics

Limitations:
- Sensitive to parameter choice
- Computationally expensive O(n²)
- Poor performance in high dimensions

3.6 Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD):
----------------------------------------
Uses angle variance instead of distance

For point p, consider all angle triplets (a,p,b)
Variance of angles indicates outlierness

Angle variance typically smaller for outliers
More robust in high dimensions than distance-based

=======================================================

4. DENSITY-BASED APPROACHES
===========================

where volume_k(x) is volume of k-NN ball

4.2 DBSCAN-Based Anomaly Detection:
----------------------------------
Use DBSCAN clustering algorithm
Points not assigned to any cluster are anomalies

Algorithm:

Advantages:

3. Anomalies have shorter average path lengths

Anomaly Score:
s(x,n) = 2^(-E(h(x))/c(n))

where:
- E(h(x)): average path length over all trees
- c(n): average path length of unsuccessful search in BST

Properties:
- s → 1: Anomaly
- s → 0.5: Normal (path length similar to average)
- s → 0: Normal (path length much longer than average)

Advantages:
- Linear time complexity O(n)
- Low memory requirements
- No distance/density computation needed
- Works well in high dimensions

Decision Function:
f(x) = sign(w·φ(x) - ρ)

Parameters:

Optimization:
min_R,a R² + C Σᵢ ξᵢ

subject to: ||φ(xᵢ) - a||² ≤ R² + ξᵢ, ξᵢ ≥ 0

Distance from center:
d(x) = ||φ(x) - a||²

Anomaly if d(x) > R²

4.6 Autoencoder-Based Detection:
-------------------------------
Train autoencoder on normal data
Anomalies have high reconstruction error

Architecture:
Input → Encoder → Latent → Decoder → Output

Loss Function:
L = ||x - x̂||²

Anomaly Score:
s(x) = ||x - f(x)||²

where f is trained autoencoder
