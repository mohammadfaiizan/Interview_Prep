2. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA)
=====================================

2.1 Mathematical Foundation:
---------------------------
Objective: Find orthogonal directions of maximum variance

Covariance Matrix:
C = (1/n)X^T X = (1/n)∑ᵢ(xᵢ - μ)(xᵢ - μ)^T

Eigenvalue Decomposition:
C = VΛV^T

where V = [v₁, v₂, ..., vₚ] are eigenvectors (principal components)
Λ = diag(λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₚ) with λ₁ ≥ λ₂ ≥ ... ≥ λₚ

2.2 PCA Algorithm:
-----------------
Standard Algorithm:
1. Center data: X_centered = X - μ
2. Compute covariance matrix C
3. Eigendecomposition: C = VΛV^T
4. Select top k eigenvectors: V_k = [v₁, ..., vₖ]
5. Project data: Y = X_centered V_k

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):
X = UΣV^T

PCA via SVD:
- Principal components: V
- Scores: U
- More numerically stable than covariance approach

2.3 Choosing Number of Components:
---------------------------------
Explained Variance Ratio:
EVR_k = λₖ / ∑ᵢλᵢ

Cumulative Explained Variance:
CEV_k = ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ λᵢ / ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵖ λᵢ

Common thresholds: 80%, 90%, 95%

Scree Plot:
- Plot eigenvalues vs component number
- Look for "elbow" where slope changes dramatically
- Kaiser criterion: Keep components with λᵢ > 1

Cross-Validation:
- Reconstruct data with k components
- Measure reconstruction error on held-out data
- Choose k minimizing validation error

2.4 Interpretation and Analysis:
-------------------------------
Principal Component Interpretation:
- First PC: Direction of maximum variance
- Second PC: Orthogonal to first, maximum remaining variance
- Loadings: vᵢⱼ indicates contribution of feature j to PC i

Biplot Visualization:
- Scatter plot of projected data (scores)
- Overlay loading vectors
- Shows both data structure and feature relationships

Component Rotation:
Varimax Rotation:
Maximize variance of squared loadings
Produces more interpretable components

2.5 Kernel PCA:
--------------
Non-linear Extension:
Map data to higher-dimensional space via kernel function
φ: X → H

Kernel Matrix:
K_ij = κ(xᵢ, xⱼ) = φ(xᵢ)^T φ(xⱼ)

Centered Kernel Matrix:
K̃ = K - 1_n K - K 1_n + 1_n K 1_n

where 1_n = (1/n) matrix of ones

Eigendecomposition:
K̃ α = λ α

Principal components in feature space:
vₖ = ∑ᵢ αₖᵢ φ(xᵢ)

2.6 Probabilistic PCA:
---------------------
Generative Model:
x = Wy + μ + ε

where:
- W ∈ ℝᵖˣᵈ: loading matrix
- y ~ N(0, I): latent variables
- ε ~ N(0, σ²I): noise

Likelihood:
p(x|W, μ, σ²) = N(μ, WW^T + σ²I)

Maximum Likelihood Solution:
W_ML = V_k (Λ_k - σ²I)^(1/2) R

where R is arbitrary orthogonal matrix

2.7 Robust PCA:
--------------
Motivation: Standard PCA sensitive to outliers

L1-PCA:
Minimize L1 norm instead of L2:
min ||X - UV^T||₁

Robust PCA via Matrix Decomposition:
X = L + S

where L is low-rank, S is sparse (outliers)

Nuclear Norm Minimization:
min ||L||* + λ||S||₁
subject to: X = L + S

2.8 Computational Considerations:
-------------------------------
