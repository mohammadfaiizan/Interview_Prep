1. CLUSTERING FUNDAMENTALS
==========================

1.1 Definition and Goals:
------------------------
Clustering: Unsupervised learning task of grouping similar objects together

Key Objectives:
- Intra-cluster similarity: Objects within cluster are similar
- Inter-cluster dissimilarity: Objects in different clusters are different
- Discover hidden structure in data
- Data summarization and compression

Mathematical Formulation:
Given dataset X = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ}, find partition C = {C₁, C₂, ..., Cₖ}
such that: ∪ᵢCᵢ = X and Cᵢ ∩ Cⱼ = ∅ for i ≠ j

1.2 Types of Clustering:
-----------------------
Hard Clustering:
- Each point belongs to exactly one cluster
- Crisp boundaries between clusters
- Examples: K-means, hierarchical clustering

Soft Clustering:
- Points can belong to multiple clusters with probabilities
- Fuzzy boundaries
- Examples: Fuzzy C-means, Gaussian mixture models

Partitional vs Hierarchical:
- Partitional: Divide data into non-overlapping clusters
- Hierarchical: Create tree of clusters (dendrogram)

1.3 Distance Metrics:
--------------------
Euclidean Distance:
d(x, y) = √(Σᵢ(xᵢ - yᵢ)²)

Manhattan Distance:
d(x, y) = Σᵢ|xᵢ - yᵢ|

Cosine Distance:
d(x, y) = 1 - (x·y)/(||x||·||y||)

Mahalanobis Distance:
d(x, y) = √((x-y)ᵀΣ⁻¹(x-y))

Choice depends on:
- Data type and distribution
- Problem domain
- Computational efficiency

1.4 Clustering Challenges:
-------------------------
Curse of Dimensionality:
- High-dimensional spaces are sparse
- Distance metrics become less meaningful
- All points become equidistant

Scalability:

Shape and Size Variation:
- Clusters may have different shapes
- Varying cluster densities
- Non-spherical clusters

Noise and Outliers:
- Noise points can distort clusters
- Outliers may form artificial clusters
- Robust clustering methods needed

1.5 Clustering Quality Measures:
-------------------------------
Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS):
WCSS = Σₖ Σₓ∈Cₖ ||x - μₖ||²

Between-Cluster Sum of Squares (BCSS):
BCSS = Σₖ |Cₖ| ||μₖ - μ||²

Silhouette Score:
s(i) = (b(i) - a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i))

where a(i) is average distance within cluster,
b(i) is average distance to nearest cluster

=======================================================

2. K-MEANS CLUSTERING
====================

2.1 Algorithm Overview:
----------------------
Objective: Minimize within-cluster sum of squared distances

Cost Function:
J = Σₖ Σₓ∈Cₖ ||x - μₖ||²

where μₖ is centroid of cluster k

Lloyd's Algorithm:
1. Initialize k centroids randomly
2. Assign each point to nearest centroid
3. Update centroids as mean of assigned points
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence

2.2 Mathematical Analysis:
-------------------------
Convergence Properties:

2. Choose next centroid with probability proportional to D²
3. Repeat until k centroids selected

where D is distance to nearest chosen centroid

Forgy Method:

- Compute centroids from assignments

2.4 Determining Optimal k:
-------------------------
Elbow Method:

- Look for "elbow" where improvement decreases
- Subjective interpretation

Silhouette Method:

----------------------
Hierarchical Clustering: Create tree-like structure of clusters

Agglomerative (Bottom-up):
- Start with each point as cluster
- Iteratively merge closest clusters
- Create dendrogram from leaves to root

Divisive (Top-down):

- Less common in practice

3.2 Agglomerative Clustering:
----------------------------
Algorithm:
1. Start with n clusters (one per point)
2. Compute distance matrix between clusters
3. Merge two closest clusters
4. Update distance matrix
5. Repeat until one cluster remains

Linkage Criteria:
Determine distance between clusters

Single Linkage (Minimum):
d(A, B) = min{d(a, b) : a ∈ A, b ∈ B}

Complete Linkage (Maximum):
d(A, B) = max{d(a, b) : a ∈ A, b ∈ B}

Average Linkage:
d(A, B) = (1/|A||B|) Σₐ∈A Σᵦ∈B d(a, b)

Ward Linkage:
d(A, B) = √(2|A||B|/(|A|+|B|)) ||μₐ - μᵦ||

3.3 Linkage Properties:
----------------------
Single Linkage:

- Often best choice for general use

3.4 Dendrogram Analysis:
-----------------------
Dendrogram: Tree diagram showing cluster hierarchy

Height: Distance at which clusters merge
- Longer branches indicate less similar clusters
- Height shows cluster cohesion

Cutting Dendrogram:

=======================================================

4. DENSITY-BASED CLUSTERING (DBSCAN)
====================================

4.1 Core Concepts:
-----------------
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise

Key Ideas:
- Clusters are dense regions separated by sparse regions
- Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters
- Robust to outliers and noise

Core Definitions:
- ε-neighborhood: Nε(p) = {q : d(p,q) ≤ ε}
- Core point: |Nε(p)| ≥ MinPts
- Border point: Not core but in ε-neighborhood of core point
- Noise point: Neither core nor border

4.2 Algorithm Description:
-------------------------
DBSCAN Algorithm:
1. For each unvisited point p:
   a. Mark p as visited
   b. If |Nε(p)| < MinPts, mark as noise
   c. Otherwise, create new cluster and expand it:
      - Add all points in Nε(p) to cluster
      - For each new core point, add its neighbors

Density Connectivity:
- Direct density-reachable: q ∈ Nε(p) and p is core
- Density-reachable: Chain of direct density-reachable points
- Density-connected: Both density-reachable from same point

Cluster Formation:
All density-connected points form a cluster

4.3 Parameter Selection:
-----------------------
ε (epsilon): Maximum distance between points
- Too small: Many points become noise
- Too large: Clusters merge together

MinPts: Minimum points in neighborhood
- Rule of thumb: MinPts ≥ dimension + 1
- Higher values → more robust to noise
- Lower values → more detailed clusters

k-distance Plot:
1. For each point, find distance to k-th nearest neighbor
2. Sort distances in descending order
3. Plot sorted distances
4. Look for "knee" in plot to choose ε

4.4 Advantages and Benefits:
---------------------------
Shape Flexibility:
- Finds clusters of arbitrary shape
- Not limited to spherical clusters
- Handles varying cluster densities

Noise Handling:
- Explicitly identifies noise points
- Robust to outliers
- No forced assignment of noise to clusters

No k Required:
- Automatically determines number of clusters
- Based on data density rather than user input

Deterministic:
- Same results for same parameters
- No random initialization

4.5 Limitations and Challenges:
------------------------------
Parameter Sensitivity:
- Difficult to choose ε and MinPts
- Different density regions require different parameters
- No automatic parameter selection

High Dimensions:
- Curse of dimensionality affects distance metrics
- All points become equidistant
- Need dimensionality reduction

Varying Densities:
- Single ε may not work for all clusters
- OPTICS algorithm addresses this limitation

Memory Usage:
- Requires computing all pairwise distances
- Space complexity O(n²) for distance matrix

4.6 Variants and Extensions:
---------------------------

E-step (Expectation):
Compute responsibilities:
γᵢₖ = πₖN(xᵢ; μₖ, Σₖ) / Σⱼ πⱼN(xᵢ; μⱼ, Σⱼ)

Update parameters:
πₖ = (1/n) Σᵢ γᵢₖ
μₖ = Σᵢ γᵢₖ xᵢ / Σᵢ γᵢₖ
