=======================================================

1. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING FUNDAMENTALS
=======================================

1.1 Basic Concepts:
------------------
Association Rule:
If-then relationship: X → Y (if X then Y)
where X and Y are itemsets (sets of items)

Example: {Milk, Bread} → {Butter}
"People who buy milk and bread also buy butter"

Terminology:
- Item: Individual element (e.g., milk, bread)
- Itemset: Set of items (e.g., {milk, bread})
- Transaction: Collection of items purchased together
- Database: Collection of all transactions

Formal Definition:
Let I = {i₁, i₂, ..., iₘ} be set of items
Let D = {T₁, T₂, ..., Tₙ} be database of transactions
where Tᵢ ⊆ I

Association Rule: X → Y where X,Y ⊆ I and X ∩ Y = ∅

1.2 Quality Measures:
--------------------
Support:
sup(X) = |{T ∈ D : X ⊆ T}| / |D|

Proportion of transactions containing itemset X

Confidence:
conf(X → Y) = sup(X ∪ Y) / sup(X)

Conditional probability: P(Y|X)

Lift:
lift(X → Y) = conf(X → Y) / sup(Y)

Measures independence: lift = 1 means independence

1.3 Problem Statement:
---------------------
Given:
- Transaction database D
- Minimum support threshold (min_sup)
- Minimum confidence threshold (min_conf)

Find:
All association rules X → Y such that:
- sup(X ∪ Y) ≥ min_sup
- conf(X → Y) ≥ min_conf

Two-Step Process:
1. Find frequent itemsets (support ≥ min_sup)
2. Generate rules from frequent itemsets (confidence ≥ min_conf)

1.4 Frequent Itemset Properties:
-------------------------------
Downward Closure (Apriori Property):
If itemset X is frequent, then all subsets of X are frequent

Contrapositive:
If itemset X is infrequent, then all supersets of X are infrequent

Pruning Strategy:
Use this property to reduce search space
Avoid checking supersets of infrequent itemsets

1.5 Rule Generation:
-------------------
From frequent itemset I, generate all possible rules:
For each non-empty subset X ⊂ I:
Generate rule X → (I - X)

Check confidence threshold:
conf(X → (I - X)) = sup(I) / sup(X) ≥ min_conf

Optimization:
If rule X → (I - X) has low confidence,
then all rules X' → (I - X') where X ⊆ X' have low confidence

3. APRIORI ALGORITHM
===================

3.1 Algorithm Overview:
----------------------
Breadth-First Search:
Generate candidate itemsets level by level
Level k contains all frequent k-itemsets

Main Steps:
1. Scan database to find frequent 1-itemsets (L₁)
2. For k = 2, 3, ... until Lₖ₋₁ is empty:
   a. Generate candidate k-itemsets (Cₖ)
   b. Scan database to count support
   c. Select frequent k-itemsets (Lₖ)

3.2 Detailed Algorithm:
----------------------
```
Apriori(D, min_sup):
    L₁ = {frequent 1-itemsets}
    k = 2
    
    while Lₖ₋₁ ≠ ∅:
        Cₖ = apriori_gen(Lₖ₋₁)
        for each transaction T ∈ D:
            Cₜ = subset(Cₖ, T)
            for each candidate c ∈ Cₜ:
                c.count++
        
        Lₖ = {c ∈ Cₖ : c.count ≥ min_sup}
        k++
    
    return ∪ᵢLᵢ
```

3.3 Candidate Generation:
-------------------------
Join Step:
For itemsets in Lₖ₋₁, join if they differ only in last item
Example: {A,B,C} and {A,B,D} → {A,B,C,D}

Prune Step:
Remove candidates whose (k-1)-subsets are not in Lₖ₋₁
Example: If {A,C,D} ∉ Lₖ₋₁, then prune {A,B,C,D}

```
apriori_gen(Lₖ₋₁):
    Cₖ = ∅
    for each l₁ ∈ Lₖ₋₁:
        for each l₂ ∈ Lₖ₋₁:
            if l₁[1:k-2] = l₂[1:k-2] and l₁[k-1] < l₂[k-1]:
                c = l₁ ∪ l₂
                if all (k-1)-subsets of c are in Lₖ₋₁:
                    Cₖ = Cₖ ∪ {c}
    return Cₖ
```

3.4 Subset Generation:
---------------------
For each transaction, find all candidate subsets:

```
subset(Cₖ, T):
    Cₜ = ∅
    for each candidate c ∈ Cₖ:
        if c ⊆ T:
            Cₜ = Cₜ ∪ {c}
    return Cₜ
```

Optimization: Use hash trees for efficient subset checking

3.5 Complexity Analysis:
-----------------------
Time Complexity:
- Database scans: k (number of levels)
- Candidate generation: O(|Lₖ₋₁|²)
- Subset checking: O(|Cₖ| × |T|) per transaction

Space Complexity:
- Store candidates and frequent itemsets
- Exponential in worst case

Bottlenecks:
- Multiple database scans
- Large number of candidates
- Memory requirements

3.6 Optimizations:
-----------------
Database Reduction:
Remove infrequent items after each scan
Smaller transactions in subsequent scans

Hash-Based Itemset Counting:
Use hash table to count 2-itemsets
Reduce candidate generation time

Transaction Reduction:
Mark and remove transactions that cannot contribute to larger itemsets

Partitioning:
Divide database into partitions
An itemset can be frequent only if frequent in at least one partition

3.7 Variants:
------------
AprioriTid:
Use candidate itemsets instead of database for counting
Avoid scanning original database

AprioriHybrid:
Combine Apriori and AprioriTid
Switch when candidate set becomes smaller than database

DHP (Direct Hashing and Pruning):
Use hash table to generate and count 2-itemsets
More efficient candidate generation

=======================================================

4. FP-GROWTH ALGORITHM
=====================

4.1 Motivation:
--------------
Apriori Limitations:
- Multiple database scans
- Large number of candidates
- Pattern explosion

FP-Growth Approach:
- Single database scan
- No candidate generation
- Compress database into FP-tree
- Mine patterns from tree

4.2 FP-Tree Structure:
---------------------
Tree Properties:
- Root labeled "null"
- Each path represents transaction
- Common prefixes share nodes
- Node contains item and count

Header Table:
- Item frequency table
- Pointers to nodes in tree
- Enables efficient traversal

Example FP-Tree:
```
       null
      /    \
   f:4      c:1
   |        |
   c:3      a:1
   /  \     |
 a:3  b:1   b:1
 |    |
 m:2  m:1
 |
 p:2
```

4.3 FP-Tree Construction:
------------------------
Two-Pass Algorithm:

First Pass:
1. Scan database once
2. Count item frequencies
3. Create header table
4. Sort items by frequency (descending)

Second Pass:
1. Scan database again
2. For each transaction:
   a. Sort items by frequency order
   b. Insert into FP-tree
   c. Update counts along path

```
FP-Tree-Construction(D, min_sup):
    // First pass
    for each transaction T ∈ D:
        for each item i ∈ T:
            count[i]++
    
    F = {items with count ≥ min_sup}
    Sort F by count (descending)
    
    // Second pass
    Create root of FP-tree
    for each transaction T ∈ D:
        T' = {items in T ∩ F, sorted by F order}
        Insert-Tree(T', root)
```

4.4 FP-Growth Mining:
--------------------
Divide-and-Conquer Strategy:
1. For each frequent item (bottom-up in header table):
   a. Construct conditional pattern base
   b. Construct conditional FP-tree
   c. Recursively mine conditional FP-tree

```
FP-Growth(FP-tree, α):
    if FP-tree contains single path P:
        return all combinations of nodes in P ∪ α
    
    for each item i in header table (bottom-up):
        β = i ∪ α
        Generate pattern β with support = i.count
        
        Construct β's conditional pattern base
        Construct β's conditional FP-tree
        if β's conditional FP-tree ≠ ∅:
            FP-Growth(β's conditional FP-tree, β)
```

4.5 Conditional Pattern Base:
----------------------------
For item i, collect all prefix paths ending at i
Include counts from nodes

Example for item 'p':
- Path: f:4, c:3, a:3, m:2 (count = 2)
- Conditional pattern base for 'p': {f,c,a,m:2}

4.6 Conditional FP-Tree:
-----------------------
Build FP-tree from conditional pattern base
May have different item ordering
Recursive mining on smaller trees

Benefits:
- No candidate generation
- Compact representation
- Efficient mining

4.7 Complexity:
--------------
Time Complexity:
- Tree construction: O(|D| × |T|avg)
- Mining: O(|FP-tree|)

Space Complexity:
- FP-tree size typically much smaller than database
- Depends on sharing among transactions

Advantages over Apriori:
- Faster execution
- Less memory usage
- No candidate generation
- Only 2 database scans

=======================================================

5. ADVANCED ASSOCIATION RULE MINING
===================================

5.1 Multilevel Association Rules:
---------------------------------
Concept Hierarchy:
Items organized in taxonomies
Example: Milk → Dairy → Food

Rules at Different Levels:
- Bread → Milk (specific level)
- Bakery → Dairy (general level)
- Bread → Dairy (cross-level)

Uniform Support:
Same minimum support for all levels
May miss interesting patterns at higher levels

Reduced Support:
Lower minimum support for higher levels
Support ratio between consecutive levels

5.2 Multidimensional Association Rules:
--------------------------------------
Multiple Attributes:
Traditional: Single dimension (items bought)
Multidimensional: Multiple attributes (age, location, items)

Types:
Interdimension Rules:
age(X, "20-29") ∧ location(X, "Vancouver") → buys(X, "laptop")

Hybrid-dimension Rules:
age(X, "20-29") ∧ buys(X, "laptop") → buys(X, "software")

Mining Approach:
Extend traditional algorithms
Consider attribute combinations
More complex candidate generation

5.3 Quantitative Association Rules:
----------------------------------
Continuous Attributes:
Age, salary, temperature, etc.
Cannot use traditional boolean approach

Discretization:
age: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49
salary: low, medium, high

Static Discretization:
Equal-width or equal-frequency binning
Domain knowledge-based

Dynamic Discretization:
Optimize binning during mining
Maximize interestingness of rules

Fuzzy Sets:
age: young, middle-aged, old
Membership functions for smooth transitions

5.4 Constraint-Based Mining:
---------------------------
User-Defined Constraints:
Focus on interesting patterns
Reduce computational complexity

Types of Constraints:
Anti-monotonic: If violated by itemset, violated by supersets
Monotonic: If satisfied by itemset, satisfied by supersets
Succinct: Define subset of items/transactions
Convertible: Anti-monotonic or monotonic under ordering

Examples:
sum(X.price) < $100 (anti-monotonic)
min(X.price) > $10 (monotonic)
X.category = "electronics" (succinct)

4.5 Incremental Mining:
----------------------
Problem:
Database updates frequently
Re-mining from scratch expensive

Approaches:
Incremental Apriori:
- Reuse previous frequent itemsets
- Only update counts for affected items

FUP (Fast Update):

- Scan only new transactions
- Update support counts incrementally

Stream Mining:
- Process transactions as they arrive
- Maintain approximate frequent itemsets
- Sliding window approach

5.6 Privacy-Preserving Mining:
-----------------------------
Privacy Concerns:
Sensitive information in transaction data
Need to mine without revealing privacy

Techniques:
Data Perturbation:
- Add noise to transactions
- Maintain statistical properties

Secure Multi-party Computation:
- Multiple parties with private data
- Jointly mine without revealing individual data

Differential Privacy:
- Add calibrated noise
- Formal privacy guarantees

k-Anonymity:
- Ensure each transaction similar to k-1 others
- Prevent individual identification

=======================================================

7. EVALUATION AND INTERESTINGNESS MEASURES
==========================================

7.1 Traditional Measures:
-------------------------
Support:
sup(X → Y) = P(X ∪ Y)
- Frequency of pattern
- May favor frequent items
- Threshold selection critical

Confidence:
conf(X → Y) = P(Y|X)
- Conditional probability
- May be misleading with high Y support
- Asymmetric measure

Lift:
lift(X → Y) = P(Y|X) / P(Y)
- Correlation measure
- lift > 1: positive correlation
- lift = 1: independence
- lift < 1: negative correlation

7.2 Alternative Measures:
------------------------
Conviction:
conv(X → Y) = P(X)P(¬Y) / P(X ∩ ¬Y)
- Measures dependence
- ∞ for perfect rules
- 1 for independence

Leverage:
lev(X → Y) = P(X ∪ Y) - P(X)P(Y)
- Difference from independence
- Range: [-0.25, 0.25]
- 0 for independence

Jaccard Coefficient:
J(X,Y) = P(X ∪ Y) / P(X ∪ Y)
- Similarity measure
- Range: [0, 1]
- Symmetric

Cosine Similarity:
cos(X,Y) = P(X ∪ Y) / √(P(X)P(Y))
- Geometric interpretation
- Range: [0, 1]
- Symmetric

7.3 Statistical Significance:
----------------------------
Chi-Square Test:
χ² = n(|ad - bc| - n/2)² / ((a+b)(c+d)(a+c)(b+d))

Where:
a = |T: X ∪ Y ⊆ T|
b = |T: X ⊆ T, Y ⊄ T|
c = |T: X ⊄ T, Y ⊆ T|
d = |T: X ⊄ T, Y ⊄ T|

Null Hypothesis: X and Y are independent
Large χ² values indicate dependence

Fisher's Exact Test:
Exact p-value for independence test
More accurate for small sample sizes

7.4 Subjective Measures:
-----------------------
Actionability:
Can the rule lead to profitable action?
Domain-specific evaluation

Unexpectedness:
Does the rule contradict prior knowledge?
Measure against background knowledge

Novelty:
Is the rule previously unknown?
Compare with existing knowledge base

Comprehensibility:
Is the rule easy to understand?
Number of conditions, complexity

7.5 Redundancy and Pruning:
--------------------------
Rule Redundancy:
Rule R1 is redundant w.r.t. R2 if:
- R1 has lower confidence
- R1 has additional conditions
- R1 provides no new information

Closed Itemsets:
Itemset with no superset having same support
Reduces number of patterns significantly

Maximal Itemsets:
Frequent itemsets with no frequent supersets
Further reduction in pattern count

Representative Rules:
Select subset of rules covering all information
Trade-off between completeness and conciseness
