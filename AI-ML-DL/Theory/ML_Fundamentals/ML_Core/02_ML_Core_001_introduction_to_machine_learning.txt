1.1 Definition and Core Concepts:
---------------------------------
Machine Learning (ML): Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel, 1959)

Modern definition: Algorithms that improve performance on a task through experience

Key components:
- Task T: The problem to be solved
- Performance measure P: How well the task is performed

A program learns if its performance at task T, measured by P, improves with experience E
