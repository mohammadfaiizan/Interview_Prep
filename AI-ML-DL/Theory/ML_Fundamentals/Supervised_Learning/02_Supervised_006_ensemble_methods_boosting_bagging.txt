=======================================================

1. ENSEMBLE LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS
=================================

1.1 Core Concepts:
-----------------
Ensemble Learning: Combine multiple models to create a stronger predictor

Key Principle: "Wisdom of crowds"
- Individual models may be weak
- Collective decision often better
- Diversity among models crucial

Base Learners (Weak Learners):
- Individual models in ensemble
- Often simple models (decision stumps, small trees)
- Each performs slightly better than random

Meta-Learning:
- Learning how to combine base learners
- Can be as simple as averaging or sophisticated stacking

1.2 Why Ensembles Work:
---------------------
Error Decomposition:
E[(f(x) - y)¬≤] = Bias¬≤ + Variance + Noise

Ensemble Benefits:
- Variance Reduction: Average out individual model errors
- Bias Reduction: Sequential learning corrects systematic errors
- Improved Robustness: Less sensitive to outliers and noise

Condorcet's Jury Theorem:
If individual classifiers have accuracy p > 0.5 and are independent:
- Ensemble accuracy increases with ensemble size
- Approaches 1 as number of classifiers ‚Üí ‚àû

1.3 Types of Ensemble Methods:
-----------------------------
Parallel Ensembles:
- Train base learners independently
- Examples: Bagging, Random Forest
- Focus on variance reduction

Sequential Ensembles:
- Train base learners sequentially
- Examples: Boosting, AdaBoost
- Focus on bias reduction

Parallel vs Sequential:
- Parallel: Can be trained in parallel, robust
- Sequential: Often more accurate, sensitive to outliers

1.4 Diversity in Ensembles:
--------------------------
Algorithmic Diversity:
- Different algorithms (trees, linear models, neural networks)
- Different hyperparameters
- Different architectures

Data Diversity:
- Different training subsets (bagging)
- Different feature subsets
- Different data transformations

Randomness Sources:
- Random sampling of data
- Random feature selection
- Random initialization
- Stochastic algorithms

Ambiguity Decomposition:
E = ƒí - AÃÖ

where E is ensemble error, ƒí is average individual error, AÃÖ is average ambiguity (diversity)

1.5 Ensemble Framework:
----------------------
Training Phase:
1. Generate diverse base learners
2. Train each base learner
3. Learn combination strategy

Prediction Phase:
1. Obtain predictions from all base learners
2. Combine predictions using meta-learner
3. Output final prediction

Combination Strategies:
- Simple averaging/voting
- Weighted averaging
- Meta-learning (stacking)
- Dynamic selection

=======================================================

2. BOOTSTRAP AGGREGATING (BAGGING)
==================================

2.1 Bootstrap Sampling:
----------------------
Bootstrap Sample:
- Sample n instances with replacement from training set
- Each bootstrap sample has ~63% unique instances
- ~37% are out-of-bag (OOB) instances

Bootstrap Bias:
E[XÃÑ*] = E[XÃÑ] (unbiased estimator)

Bootstrap Variance:
Var[XÃÑ*] = Var[XÃÑ]/B + (1-1/B)Cov[XÃÑ·µ¢*, XÃÑ‚±º*]

where B is number of bootstrap samples

2.2 Bagging Algorithm:
---------------------
Training:
1. Generate B bootstrap samples: D‚ÇÅ*, D‚ÇÇ*, ..., D·µ¶*
2. Train base learner on each sample: h‚ÇÅ, h‚ÇÇ, ..., h·µ¶
3. Store all trained models

Prediction:
- Regression: ƒ•(x) = (1/B) Œ£·µ¶ h·µ¶(x)
- Classification: Majority vote or average probabilities

Out-of-Bag Error:
- Use OOB samples as validation set
- No need for separate test set
- Unbiased estimate of generalization error

2.3 Theoretical Analysis:
------------------------
Variance Reduction:
If base learners have variance œÉ¬≤ and correlation œÅ:
Var[ensemble] = œÅœÉ¬≤ + (1-œÅ)œÉ¬≤/B

Key insights:
- Lower correlation ‚Üí better variance reduction
- More models ‚Üí better variance reduction (diminishing returns)

Bias:
E[ensemble] = E[base learner]
Bagging doesn't reduce bias

2.4 Random Forests:
------------------
Enhancement to Bagging:
1. Bootstrap sampling (as in bagging)
2. Random feature selection at each split
3. Grow deep trees (low bias)

Feature Randomness:
- At each node, select mtry features randomly
- Choose best split among selected features
- Typical values: mtry = ‚àöp (classification), p/3 (regression)

Advantages:
- Further decorrelates trees
- Handles high-dimensional data
- Built-in feature importance
- Excellent default performance

2.5 Extremely Randomized Trees:
------------------------------
Additional Randomization:
- Use entire training set (no bootstrap)
- Random thresholds for splits
- Faster training

Algorithm:
1. For each tree, use full training set
2. At each node, randomly select features
3. For each feature, randomly select threshold
4. Choose best random split

Trade-offs:
- Higher bias, lower variance than Random Forest
- Often competitive performance
- Much faster training

2.6 Feature Importance:
----------------------
Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI):
I‚±º = Œ£‚Çú Œ£‚Çô p(n) * Œîi(n) * ùüô[v(n) = j]

where p(n) is proportion of samples reaching node n

Permutation Importance:
1. Calculate OOB error
2. Permute feature j in OOB samples
3. Recalculate OOB error
4. Importance = increase in error

Advantages of Permutation:
- Less biased toward high-cardinality features
- Model-agnostic
- More reliable

2.7 Hyperparameter Tuning:
-------------------------
Key Parameters:
- n_estimators: Number of trees (more is usually better)
- max_features: Features per split (controls randomness)
- max_depth: Tree depth (controls overfitting)
- min_samples_split: Minimum samples to split
- min_samples_leaf: Minimum samples per leaf

Tuning Strategy:
1. Start with defaults
2. Increase n_estimators until performance plateaus
3. Tune max_features via cross-validation
4. Adjust tree-specific parameters if needed

=======================================================

3. BOOSTING ALGORITHMS
======================

3.1 Boosting Principles:
-----------------------
Sequential Learning:
- Train weak learners sequentially
- Each learner corrects mistakes of previous ensemble
- Focus on difficult examples

Weak Learning Assumption:
Any learning algorithm that performs slightly better than random can be boosted to arbitrarily high accuracy

AdaBoost Insight:
Exponentially re-weight training examples based on current ensemble performance

3.2 AdaBoost Algorithm:
----------------------
Initialization:
w‚ÇÅ‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ = 1/n for i = 1, ..., n

For t = 1, ..., T:
1. Train weak learner h‚Çú on weighted training set
2. Calculate weighted error: Œµ‚Çú = Œ£·µ¢ w‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ‚Çú ùüô[y·µ¢ ‚â† h‚Çú(x·µ¢)] / Œ£·µ¢ w‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ‚Çú
3. Calculate classifier weight: Œ±‚Çú = ¬Ω log((1-Œµ‚Çú)/Œµ‚Çú)
4. Update weights: w‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ = w‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ‚Çú exp(-Œ±‚Çúy·µ¢h‚Çú(x·µ¢))
5. Normalize weights

Final Classifier:
H(x) = sign(Œ£‚Çú Œ±‚Çúh‚Çú(x))

3.3 AdaBoost Analysis:
---------------------
Training Error Bound:
Training error ‚â§ ‚àè‚Çú 2‚àö(Œµ‚Çú(1-Œµ‚Çú))

If Œµ‚Çú ‚â§ ¬Ω - Œ≥ for all t:
Training error ‚â§ exp(-2Œ≥¬≤T)

Exponential decay in training error!

Generalization Bound:
With probability 1-Œ¥:
P(H(x) ‚â† y) ‚â§ PÃÇ(H(x) ‚â† y) + O(‚àö((d log(n/d) + log(1/Œ¥))/n))

where d is VC dimension of base learner class

3.4 Loss Function Perspective:
-----------------------------
AdaBoost minimizes exponential loss:
L(y, f(x)) = exp(-yf(x))

Gradient View:
- Negative gradient: y·µ¢exp(-y·µ¢f(x·µ¢))
- Proportional to sample weights in AdaBoost

Connection to Logistic Regression:
Both minimize convex surrogates of 0-1 loss:
- AdaBoost: Exponential loss
- Logistic: Logistic loss

3.5 Gradient Boosting:
---------------------
General Framework:
F‚ÇÄ(x) = argmin_Œ≥ Œ£·µ¢ L(y·µ¢, Œ≥)

For m = 1, ..., M:
1. Compute pseudo-residuals: r·µ¢‚Çò = -‚àÇL(y·µ¢, F(x·µ¢))/‚àÇF|F=F‚Çò‚Çã‚ÇÅ
2. Fit base learner h‚Çò to residuals: h‚Çò = argmin_h Œ£·µ¢ (r·µ¢‚Çò - h(x·µ¢))¬≤
3. Find step size: Œ≥‚Çò = argmin_Œ≥ Œ£·µ¢ L(y·µ¢, F‚Çò‚Çã‚ÇÅ(x·µ¢) + Œ≥h‚Çò(x·µ¢))
4. Update: F‚Çò(x) = F‚Çò‚Çã‚ÇÅ(x) + Œ≥‚Çòh‚Çò(x)

3.6 Common Loss Functions:
-------------------------
Regression:
- Squared Loss: L(y,f) = ¬Ω(y-f)¬≤
- Absolute Loss: L(y,f) = |y-f|
- Huber Loss: Smooth combination of squared and absolute

Classification:
- Exponential: L(y,f) = exp(-yf) (AdaBoost)
- Logistic: L(y,f) = log(1 + exp(-yf))
- Hinge: L(y,f) = max(0, 1-yf)

Robust Losses:
- Less sensitive to outliers
- Better generalization in noisy settings

3.7 Regularization in Boosting:
------------------------------
Shrinkage (Learning Rate):
F‚Çò(x) = F‚Çò‚Çã‚ÇÅ(x) + ŒΩ¬∑Œ≥‚Çòh‚Çò(x)

where ŒΩ ‚àà (0,1] is learning rate

Stochastic Gradient Boosting:
- Subsample training data for each iteration
- Typical subsample ratio: 0.5-0.8
- Reduces overfitting and improves speed

Early Stopping:
- Monitor validation error
- Stop when validation error stops improving
- Prevents overfitting

3.8 XGBoost Innovations:
-----------------------
Regularized Objective:
Obj = Œ£·µ¢ l(y·µ¢, ≈∑·µ¢) + Œ£‚Çú Œ©(f‚Çú)

where Œ©(f) = Œ≥T + ¬ΩŒª||w||¬≤

Second-Order Approximation:
Use both gradient and Hessian information
More accurate than first-order methods

System Optimizations:
- Parallel tree construction
- Cache-aware algorithms
- Sparse-aware algorithms
- Approximate tree learning

Soft Voting (Probability Averaging):
ƒ•(x) = argmax_k (1/M) Œ£‚Çò P(y = k|x, h‚Çò)

When to Use:
- Hard voting: When only class predictions available
- Soft voting: When probability estimates available (usually better)

4.2 Weighted Voting:
-------------------
Weighted Average:
ƒ•(x) = Œ£‚Çò w‚Çòh‚Çò(x) / Œ£‚Çò w‚Çò

Weight Selection:
- Uniform weights: w‚Çò = 1/M
- Performance-based: w‚Çò ‚àù validation accuracy
- Inverse error: w‚Çò ‚àù 1/error_m
- Learned weights: Optimize on validation set

Dynamic Weighting:
Weights can depend on input x:
ƒ•(x) = Œ£‚Çò w‚Çò(x)h‚Çò(x)

4.3 Bayesian Model Averaging:
----------------------------
Posterior Model Probability:
P(M|D) ‚àù P(D|M)P(M)

where g_m(x) = softmax(v‚Çò·µÄx)

4.5 Selection vs Combination:
----------------------------
Dynamic Selection:
- Choose best model for each input
- Based on local competence
- Risk of overfitting to validation set

Combination:
