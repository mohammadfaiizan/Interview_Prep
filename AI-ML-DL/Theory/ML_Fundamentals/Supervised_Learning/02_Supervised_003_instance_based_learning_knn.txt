=======================================================

1. INSTANCE-BASED LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS
=======================================

1.1 Core Concepts:
-----------------
Instance-Based Learning (IBL): Learn by storing and comparing new instances to stored training instances

Key Characteristics:
- Lazy learning: Defer computation until query time
- Non-parametric: No fixed parameters learned
- Local approximation: Use nearby instances for prediction
- Memory-based: Store entire training dataset

Contrast with Eager Learning:
- Eager: Build global model during training
- Lazy: Make local decisions at prediction time
- Trade-off: Storage vs computation

1.2 Theoretical Foundation:
--------------------------
Locality Assumption: Similar instances have similar outputs
‚àÄx, x': d(x, x') small ‚üπ |f(x) - f(x')| small

where d(¬∑,¬∑) is distance function and f is target function

Cover-Hart Theorem:
For k-NN with k=1, as n ‚Üí ‚àû:
R‚ÇÅ ‚â§ R* ‚â§ 2R‚ÇÅ

where R‚ÇÅ is 1-NN error rate and R* is Bayes error rate

Asymptotic Error Bound:
lim(n‚Üí‚àû) E[R‚ÇÅ] ‚â§ 2R*(1 - R*)

1.3 Instance Representation:
---------------------------
Feature Vector: x = (x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çö)
- Numerical features: Continuous values
- Categorical features: Discrete categories
- Mixed features: Combination of both

Distance-based Similarity:
sim(x·µ¢, x‚±º) = 1/(1 + d(x·µ¢, x‚±º))

Kernel-based Similarity:
sim(x·µ¢, x‚±º) = K(x·µ¢, x‚±º)

1.4 Advantages and Limitations:
------------------------------
Advantages:
- Simple and intuitive
- No training phase required
- Naturally handles multi-class problems
- Adapts to local patterns
- Non-linear decision boundaries
- Works with any distance metric

Limitations:
- Computationally expensive at prediction time
