=======================================================

1. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE FUNDAMENTALS
======================================

1.1 Geometric Intuition:
-----------------------
Linear Separability:
Find hyperplane w·x + b = 0 that separates classes with maximum margin

Margin Definition:
γ = 2/||w|| (distance between parallel supporting hyperplanes)

Decision Function:
f(x) = sign(w·x + b)

Key Insight: Maximize margin ⟺ Minimize ||w||²

1.2 Maximum Margin Principle:
----------------------------
Optimal Hyperplane:
- Maximizes minimum distance to training points
- Unique solution (if exists)
- Depends only on support vectors

Support Vectors:
Training points closest to separating hyperplane
- Satisfy |wᵀxᵢ + b| = 1
- Define the margin
- Critical for generalization

Generalization Theory:
Leave-one-out error ≤ E[#Support Vectors]/n

1.3 From Perceptron to SVM:
--------------------------
Perceptron Algorithm:
- Finds any separating hyperplane
- No margin optimization
- Sensitive to initialization

SVM Advantages:
- Unique optimal solution
- Maximizes margin
- Better generalization
- Kernel extension possible

1.4 Linearly Separable Case:
---------------------------
Optimization Problem:
min_{w,b} ½||w||²
subject to: yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) ≥ 1, ∀i

Geometric Constraints:
- Correct classification: yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) > 0
- Minimum margin: yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) ≥ 1

Solution Properties:
- Convex quadratic program
- Global optimum guaranteed
- Sparse solution (few support vectors)

1.5 Statistical Learning Theory:
-------------------------------
VC Dimension:
- Linear classifiers in ℝᵈ: VC dim = d + 1
- SVM effective dimension may be lower
- Depends on margin and data distribution

Generalization Bound:
R(f) ≤ R̂(f) + O(√((d/n) log(n/d)))

where effective dimension d may be much smaller than input dimension

=======================================================

2. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION AND OPTIMIZATION
============================================

2.1 Primal Problem (Hard Margin):
--------------------------------
Optimization Formulation:
min_{w,b} ½wᵀw
subject to: yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) ≥ 1, i = 1,...,n

Lagrangian:
L(w,b,α) = ½wᵀw - Σᵢ αᵢ[yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) - 1]

KKT Conditions:
∇_w L = w - Σᵢ αᵢyᵢxᵢ = 0 ⟹ w = Σᵢ αᵢyᵢxᵢ
∇_b L = -Σᵢ αᵢyᵢ = 0 ⟹ Σᵢ αᵢyᵢ = 0
αᵢ ≥ 0
yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) ≥ 1
αᵢ[yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) - 1] = 0 (complementary slackness)

2.2 Dual Problem:
----------------
Dual Formulation:
max_α Σᵢ αᵢ - ½Σᵢ Σⱼ αᵢαⱼyᵢyⱼ(xᵢᵀxⱼ)
subject to: Σᵢ αᵢyᵢ = 0, αᵢ ≥ 0

Matrix Form:
max_α 1ᵀα - ½αᵀQα
subject to: yᵀα = 0, α ≥ 0

where Q_{ij} = yᵢyⱼ(xᵢᵀxⱼ)

Advantages of Dual:
- Only depends on inner products xᵢᵀxⱼ
- Enables kernel trick
- Often easier to solve
- Natural sparsity (many αᵢ = 0)

2.3 Soft Margin SVM:
-------------------
Motivation: Handle non-separable data

Primal Problem:
min_{w,b,ξ} ½wᵀw + C Σᵢ ξᵢ
subject to: yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) ≥ 1 - ξᵢ, ξᵢ ≥ 0

Slack Variables ξᵢ:
- ξᵢ = 0: Correctly classified with margin ≥ 1
- 0 < ξᵢ < 1: Correctly classified with margin < 1  
- ξᵢ ≥ 1: Misclassified

Dual Problem:
max_α Σᵢ αᵢ - ½Σᵢ Σⱼ αᵢαⱼyᵢyⱼ(xᵢᵀxⱼ)
subject to: Σᵢ αᵢyᵢ = 0, 0 ≤ αᵢ ≤ C

2.4 Support Vector Types:
------------------------
Free Support Vectors: 0 < αᵢ < C
- On margin boundary
- Used to compute b

Bounded Support Vectors: αᵢ = C
- Inside margin or misclassified
- Constrained by regularization

Non-Support Vectors: αᵢ = 0
- Correctly classified with large margin
- Don't affect decision boundary

2.5 Bias Term Computation:
-------------------------
From KKT conditions:
For any free support vector (0 < αᵢ < C):
b = yᵢ - Σⱼ αⱼyⱼ(xⱼᵀxᵢ)

Robust Estimation:
b = (1/|S|) Σᵢ∈S [yᵢ - Σⱼ αⱼyⱼ(xⱼᵀxᵢ)]

where S = {i : 0 < αᵢ < C}

=======================================================

3. KERNEL THEORY AND THE KERNEL TRICK
=====================================

3.1 Feature Mapping and Kernels:
-------------------------------
Feature Mapping: φ: X → H
Transform input space to higher-dimensional feature space

Kernel Function:
K(x, x') = φ(x)ᵀφ(x')

Kernel Trick:
Replace all inner products with kernel evaluations
Never explicitly compute φ(x)

3.2 Mercer's Theorem:
--------------------
Conditions for Valid Kernels:
A function K(x, x') is a valid kernel if and only if:
1. K is symmetric: K(x, x') = K(x', x)
2. K is positive semidefinite:
   ∫∫ K(x, x') g(x) g(x') dx dx' ≥ 0
   for any square-integrable function g

Discrete Version:
For any x₁, ..., xₙ, the Gram matrix K with K_{ij} = K(xᵢ, xⱼ) must be positive semidefinite

3.3 Common Kernel Functions:
---------------------------
Linear Kernel:
K(x, x') = xᵀx'

Polynomial Kernel:
K(x, x') = (xᵀx' + c)ᵈ

Gaussian RBF Kernel:
K(x, x') = exp(-||x - x'||²/(2σ²))

Sigmoid Kernel:
K(x, x') = tanh(αxᵀx' + β)

Laplacian Kernel:
K(x, x') = exp(-||x - x'||₁/σ)

3.4 Kernel Properties:
---------------------
Closure Properties:
If K₁, K₂ are kernels, then:
- K(x, x') = K₁(x, x') + K₂(x, x')
- K(x, x') = αK₁(x, x') for α > 0
- K(x, x') = K₁(x, x') · K₂(x, x')
- K(x, x') = f(x) · K₁(x, x') · f(x') for any function f

Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS):
- Unique RKHS H associated with each kernel

4.2 SVR (Support Vector Regression):
-----------------------------------
ε-insensitive Loss:
L_ε(y, f(x)) = max(0, |y - f(x)| - ε)

Primal Problem:
min_{w,b,ξ,ξ*} ½||w||² + C Σᵢ (ξᵢ + ξᵢ*)
subject to:
yᵢ - wᵀxᵢ - b ≤ ε + ξᵢ
wᵀxᵢ + b - yᵢ ≤ ε + ξᵢ*
ξᵢ, ξᵢ* ≥ 0

Dual Problem:
max_{α,α*} Σᵢ yᵢ(αᵢ - αᵢ*) - ε Σᵢ (αᵢ + αᵢ*) - ½Σᵢⱼ (αᵢ - αᵢ*)(αⱼ - αⱼ*)K(xᵢ, xⱼ)
subject to: Σᵢ (αᵢ - αᵢ*) = 0, 0 ≤ αᵢ, αᵢ* ≤ C

4.3 ν-SVM:
---------

ν ∈ (0, 1] controls trade-off between ε and number of errors

4.4 One-Class SVM:
-----------------

Find region containing most of the data

Formulation:
min_{w,ξ,ρ} ½||w||² + (1/νn)Σᵢ ξᵢ - ρ
subject to: wᵀφ(xᵢ) ≥ ρ - ξᵢ, ξᵢ ≥ 0

Decision Function:
f(x) = sign(wᵀφ(x) - ρ)

4.5 Least Squares SVM:
---------------------
Replace inequality constraints with equality:
min_{w,b,e} ½||w||² + ½γ Σᵢ eᵢ²
subject to: yᵢ(wᵀφ(xᵢ) + b) = 1 - eᵢ

Solution:
Linear system instead of QP
Faster training but loss of sparsity

4.6 Fuzzy SVM:
-------------
Different weights for different training points:
min_{w,b,ξ} ½||w||² + C Σᵢ sᵢξᵢ

where sᵢ ∈ (0, 1] is membership degree

Applications:
- Noisy data
- Imbalanced classes
- Uncertainty modeling
