=======================================================

1. DECISION TREE FUNDAMENTALS
=============================

1.1 Tree Structure and Representation:
-------------------------------------
Basic Components:
- Root Node: Top of the tree, no incoming edges
- Internal Nodes: Decision nodes with splitting criteria
- Leaf Nodes: Terminal nodes with predictions
- Branches: Edges connecting nodes

Mathematical Representation:
T = {t‚ÇÅ, t‚ÇÇ, ..., t‚Çñ} where t·µ¢ are leaf nodes

Prediction Function:
f(x) = Œ£‚Çñ c‚Çñ ¬∑ ùüô(x ‚àà R‚Çñ)

where R‚Çñ is the region defined by leaf k

1.2 Splitting Criteria for Classification:
-----------------------------------------
Gini Impurity:
Gini(t) = 1 - Œ£·∂ú p·∂ú¬≤

where p·∂ú is proportion of class c in node t

Information Gain (Entropy):
Entropy(t) = -Œ£·∂ú p·∂ú log‚ÇÇ(p·∂ú)

Information Gain:
IG(t, split) = Entropy(t) - Œ£·µ¢ (|t·µ¢|/|t|) √ó Entropy(t·µ¢)

Misclassification Error:
Error(t) = 1 - max·∂ú p·∂ú

Comparison:
- Gini: Computationally efficient, smooth
- Entropy: More sensitive to probability changes
- Error: Less sensitive, used for pruning

1.3 Splitting Criteria for Regression:
-------------------------------------
Mean Squared Error:
MSE(t) = (1/|t|) Œ£·µ¢‚ààt (y·µ¢ - »≥‚Çú)¬≤

where »≥‚Çú is the mean of responses in node t

Mean Absolute Error:
MAE(t) = (1/|t|) Œ£·µ¢‚ààt |y·µ¢ - median‚Çú(y)|

Reduction in Impurity:
ŒîI = I(t) - Œ£·µ¢ (|t·µ¢|/|t|) √ó I(t·µ¢)

1.4 Tree Growth Process:
-----------------------
Recursive Binary Splitting:
1. Start with all data in root node
2. For each feature and threshold:
   - Split data into two subsets
   - Calculate impurity reduction
3. Choose split maximizing reduction
4. Recursively apply to child nodes
5. Stop when criteria met

Stopping Criteria:
- Minimum samples per leaf
- Minimum samples to split
- Maximum depth
- Minimum impurity decrease
- Pure nodes (single class)

1.5 Advantages and Limitations:
------------------------------
Advantages:

=======================================================

2. TREE CONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS
===============================

2.1 CART (Classification and Regression Trees):
----------------------------------------------
Algorithm Overview:
- Binary splits only
- Exhaustive search for best split
- Cost-complexity pruning
- Handles missing values via surrogates

Split Selection:
For continuous features:
- Sort feature values
- Try all midpoints as thresholds
- O(n log n) complexity per feature

For categorical features:
- Binary partitions of categories
- 2^(k-1) - 1 possible splits for k categories
- Computationally expensive for high cardinality

Surrogate Splits:
- Alternative splits for missing values
- Use highly correlated features
- Maintain tree structure integrity

2.2 Cost-Complexity Pruning:
---------------------------
Tree Complexity:
R_Œ±(T) = R(T) + Œ±|TÃÉ|

where:
- R(T): Misclassification cost
- |TÃÉ|: Number of terminal nodes
- Œ±: Complexity parameter

Pruning Process:
1. Find weakest link (smallest Œ± for pruning)
2. Remove subtree with smallest g(t) = (R(t) - R(T‚Çú))/(|TÃÉ‚Çú| - 1)
3. Repeat until only root remains
4. Select optimal Œ± via cross-validation

Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning:
- Generate sequence of nested trees
- Cross-validate each tree size
- Select tree minimizing CV error

2.3 ID3 and C4.5 Algorithms:
---------------------------
ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3):
- Uses information gain for splitting
- Handles categorical features only
- No pruning mechanism
- Prone to overfitting

C4.5 Improvements:
- Handles continuous features (discretization)
- Uses gain ratio: GainRatio = IG / SplitInfo
- Post-pruning using error-based pruning
- Handles missing values

Gain Ratio:
SplitInfo(t, X) = -Œ£·µ¢ (|t·µ¢|/|t|) log‚ÇÇ(|t·µ¢|/|t|)
GainRatio(t, X) = IG(t, X) / SplitInfo(t, X)

2.4 Handling Missing Values:
---------------------------
Surrogate Variables:
- Find splits most similar to primary split
- Use in order of similarity
- CART approach

Probabilistic Approach:
- Send fraction of instances down each branch
- Weight by probability of going that direction
- Aggregate predictions at leaves

Imputation Methods:
- Fill missing values before tree construction
- Use median/mode for numerical/categorical
- Advanced: Multiple imputation

2.5 Tree Visualization and Interpretation:
-----------------------------------------
Decision Paths:
- Sequence of if-then rules from root to leaf
- Easily translatable to business rules
- Natural explanation of predictions

Tree Depth Analysis:
- Shallow trees: More interpretable, higher bias
- Deep trees: Complex patterns, higher variance
- Optimal depth via validation

Feature Importance:
I(X‚±º) = Œ£‚Çú p(t) √ó ŒîI(t) √ó ùüô(split on X‚±º)

where p(t) is proportion of samples reaching node t

=======================================================

3. RANDOM FORESTS AND BAGGING
=============================

3.1 Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging):
-----------------------------------
Algorithm:
1. Generate B bootstrap samples: S‚ÇÅ*, S‚ÇÇ*, ..., S·µ¶*
2. Train tree on each bootstrap sample: T‚ÇÅ, T‚ÇÇ, ..., T·µ¶
3. Aggregate predictions:
   - Regression: fÃÇ(x) = (1/B) Œ£·µ¶ T·µ¶(x)
   - Classification: Majority vote

Bootstrap Sampling:
- Sample n instances with replacement
- ~63% unique instances per bootstrap
- ~37% out-of-bag (OOB) instances

Variance Reduction:
Var(fÃÇ) = Var(T)/B + (1 - 1/B) √ó Cov(T·µ¢, T‚±º)

Key insight: Reduce correlation between trees

3.2 Random Forest Algorithm:
---------------------------
Modifications to Bagging:
1. Bootstrap sampling (as in bagging)
2. Random feature selection at each split
3. Typically mtry = ‚àöp for classification, p/3 for regression
4. Grow deep trees (minimal pruning)

Feature Randomness:
- At each node, randomly select mtry features
- Choose best split among these features only
- Decorrelates trees further
- Reduces overfitting

Out-of-Bag Error:
- Use OOB samples as validation set
- No need for separate validation data
- OOB error ‚âà test error for large B

3.3 Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra Trees):
--------------------------------------------
Additional Randomization:
- Random thresholds for splits (not just features)
- Use entire dataset (no bootstrap)
- Further reduces correlation
- Faster training

Split Selection:
1. Randomly select mtry features
2. For each feature, randomly select threshold
3. Choose split with highest score among random candidates

Trade-offs:
- Higher bias but lower variance than Random Forest
- Often comparable performance
- Faster training and prediction

3.4 Feature Importance in Random Forests:
----------------------------------------
Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI):
I(X‚±º) = (1/B) Œ£·µ¶ Œ£‚Çú p(t) √ó ŒîI(t) √ó ùüô(split on X‚±º)

Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA):
1. Calculate OOB error
2. Permute feature j in OOB samples
3. Recalculate OOB error
4. Importance = increase in error

Permutation Importance:
- More reliable than MDI
- Less biased toward high-cardinality features
- Can be computed for any model

3.5 Hyperparameter Tuning:
-------------------------
Key Parameters:
- n_estimators: Number of trees (B)
- max_features: Features per split (mtry)
- max_depth: Maximum tree depth
- min_samples_split: Minimum samples to split
- min_samples_leaf: Minimum samples per leaf

Tuning Guidelines:

- Increase n_estimators until OOB error stabilizes
- Tune max_features via cross-validation
- Adjust tree-specific parameters for fine-tuning

   c. Update F‚Çò(x) = F‚Çò‚Çã‚ÇÅ(x) + Œ∑h‚Çò(x)

Learning Rate:
