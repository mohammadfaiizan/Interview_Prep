1. CLASSIFICATION METRICS FUNDAMENTALS
======================================

1.1 Classification Problem Setup:
--------------------------------
Binary Classification:
Two possible outcomes: Positive (1) and Negative (0)
Examples: Spam detection, medical diagnosis, fraud detection

Multi-class Classification:
Multiple discrete outcomes: Classes {1, 2, ..., K}
Examples: Image recognition, sentiment analysis

Multi-label Classification:
Multiple binary outcomes simultaneously
Examples: Tag prediction, medical symptom diagnosis

Evaluation Objectives:
- Overall performance assessment
- Class-specific performance analysis
- Model comparison and selection
- Threshold optimization

1.2 Prediction Types:
--------------------
Hard Predictions:
Discrete class assignments
ŷ ∈ {0, 1} for binary classification

Soft Predictions:
Probability estimates or confidence scores
P(y = 1|x) ∈ [0, 1]

Ranking:
Ordered list of instances by predicted probability
Useful for recommendation systems

Decision Thresholds:
Converting probabilities to hard predictions
ŷ = 1 if P(y = 1|x) ≥ τ, else 0

1.3 Ground Truth and Prediction Errors:
--------------------------------------
True Positives (TP):
Correctly predicted positive instances
Model predicts positive, actual is positive

True Negatives (TN):
Correctly predicted negative instances
Model predicts negative, actual is negative

False Positives (FP):
Incorrectly predicted positive instances
Model predicts positive, actual is negative
Type I error, False alarm

False Negatives (FN):

Model predicts negative, actual is positive
Type II error, Miss

1.4 Cost-Sensitive Evaluation:
-----------------------------
Asymmetric Costs:
Different costs for different error types
Medical diagnosis: FN (missing disease) vs FP (false alarm)

Cost Matrix:

=======================================================

2. CONFUSION MATRIX AND BASIC METRICS
=====================================

2.1 Confusion Matrix Structure:
------------------------------
Binary Classification Matrix:
                 Predicted
Actual     |  Negative | Positive
-----------|-----------|----------
Negative   |    TN     |    FP
Positive   |    FN     |    TP

Properties:
- Total instances: n = TP + TN + FP + FN
- Positive instances: P = TP + FN
- Negative instances: N = TN + FP
- Predicted positive: PP = TP + FP
- Predicted negative: PN = TN + FN

Multi-class Confusion Matrix:
C[i,j] = number of instances of class i predicted as class j
Diagonal elements are correct predictions
Off-diagonal elements are misclassifications

2.2 Accuracy:
------------
Definition:
Fraction of correct predictions
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) = (TP + TN) / n

Mathematical Properties:
- Range: [0, 1]
- Higher is better
- Baseline: Majority class frequency

Limitations:
- Misleading for imbalanced datasets
- Treats all errors equally
- Doesn't distinguish error types

Example:
99% negative class, 1% positive class
Always predicting negative: 99% accuracy
But 0% recall for positive class

2.3 Error Rate:
--------------
Definition:
Fraction of incorrect predictions
Error Rate = (FP + FN) / n = 1 - Accuracy

Alternative Names:
- Misclassification rate
- Classification error

Relationship to Accuracy:
Error Rate + Accuracy = 1

2.4 Balanced Accuracy:
---------------------
Definition:
Average of class-specific accuracies
Balanced Accuracy = (Sensitivity + Specificity) / 2

Sensitivity (True Positive Rate):
Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = TP / P

Specificity (True Negative Rate):
Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = TN / N

Benefits:
- Accounts for class imbalance
- Equal weight to all classes
- More informative than accuracy for skewed data

Range:
[0, 1] with 0.5 as random performance baseline

2.5 Class-Specific Accuracies:
-----------------------------
Positive Predictive Value (Precision):
PPV = TP / (TP + FP)
Of predicted positives, fraction that are correct

Negative Predictive Value:
NPV = TN / (TN + FN)
Of predicted negatives, fraction that are correct

True Positive Rate (Recall/Sensitivity):
TPR = TP / (TP + FN)
Of actual positives, fraction correctly identified

True Negative Rate (Specificity):
TNR = TN / (TN + FP)
Of actual negatives, fraction correctly identified

False Positive Rate:
FPR = FP / (TN + FP) = 1 - Specificity
Of actual negatives, fraction incorrectly identified

False Negative Rate:
FNR = FN / (TP + FN) = 1 - Sensitivity
Of actual positives, fraction incorrectly identified

=======================================================

3. PRECISION, RECALL, AND F-SCORE
=================================

3.1 Precision:
-------------
Definition:
Fraction of predicted positives that are actually positive
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Interpretation:
- Quality of positive predictions
- "When the model says positive, how often is it right?"
- Answers: "How precise are the positive predictions?"

Use Cases:
- Spam detection (avoid marking legitimate emails as spam)
- Medical tests (avoid false alarms)
- Information retrieval (relevant documents in results)

Mathematical Properties:
- Range: [0, 1]
- Undefined when TP + FP = 0 (no positive predictions)
- Higher is better

3.2 Recall (Sensitivity):
------------------------
Definition:
Fraction of actual positives that are correctly identified
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

Interpretation:
- Completeness of positive predictions
- "Of all actual positives, how many did we find?"
- Answers: "How complete is our detection?"

Use Cases:
- Medical diagnosis (don't miss diseases)
- Fraud detection (catch all fraudulent transactions)
- Security systems (detect all threats)

Alternative Names:
- Sensitivity
- True Positive Rate (TPR)
- Hit Rate

3.3 Precision-Recall Trade-off:
------------------------------
Fundamental Trade-off:
Increasing precision often decreases recall and vice versa

Threshold Effect:
- Lower threshold: Higher recall, lower precision
- Higher threshold: Higher precision, lower recall

Mathematical Relationship:
For fixed dataset, precision and recall are generally inversely related
Can be analyzed via precision-recall curves

Business Implications:
- High precision: Conservative model, fewer false alarms
- High recall: Liberal model, catches more true positives
- Need to balance based on costs of FP vs FN

3.4 F-Score (F-Measure):
-----------------------
F1-Score:
Harmonic mean of precision and recall
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

Alternative Formulation:
F1 = 2TP / (2TP + FP + FN)

Properties:
- Range: [0, 1]
- Equals 0 if either precision or recall is 0
- Maximum when precision = recall
- Penalizes extreme values

Harmonic vs Arithmetic Mean:
Harmonic mean is more conservative
Dominated by smaller value

3.5 F-Beta Score:
----------------
Generalized F-Score:
Fβ = (1 + β²) × (Precision × Recall) / (β² × Precision + Recall)

Parameter Interpretation:
- β < 1: Emphasizes precision
- β > 1: Emphasizes recall
- β = 1: Equal weight (F1-score)
- β = 0.5: F0.5, favors precision
- β = 2: F2, favors recall

Use Cases:
- β = 0.5: When precision is more important (spam detection)
- β = 2: When recall is more important (medical diagnosis)

Mathematical Properties:
- Fβ → Precision as β → 0
- Fβ → Recall as β → ∞
- Weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall

3.6 Macro and Micro Averaging:
------------------------------
Macro-averaged F1:
Calculate F1 for each class, then average
F1_macro = (1/K) Σₖ F1ₖ

Micro-averaged F1:
Pool all true positives, false positives, false negatives
F1_micro = 2 × (TP_total) / (2×TP_total + FP_total + FN_total)

Differences:
- Macro: Treats all classes equally
- Micro: Weighted by class frequency
- Micro favors performance on frequent classes

When to Use:
- Macro: When all classes equally important
- Micro: When instances equally important

=======================================================

4. ROC CURVES AND AUC ANALYSIS
==============================

4.1 ROC Curve Fundamentals:
--------------------------
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC):
Plot of True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate
Varies classification threshold

TPR = TP / (TP + FN) = Sensitivity
FPR = FP / (FP + TN) = 1 - Specificity

ROC Space:
- (0,0): Perfect negative classifier
- (1,1): Perfect positive classifier
- (0,1): Perfect classifier
- (1,0): Perfectly wrong classifier
- (0.5,0.5): Random classifier

4.2 Constructing ROC Curves:
---------------------------
Algorithm:
1. Sort instances by predicted probability (descending)
2. For each unique threshold:
   a. Classify instances above threshold as positive
   b. Calculate TPR and FPR
   c. Plot point (FPR, TPR)
3. Connect points to form curve

Efficient Algorithm:
Only need to consider thresholds at predicted probabilities
Reduces computational complexity

Interpolation:
Linear interpolation between threshold points
Assumes constant slope between points

4.3 Area Under ROC Curve (AUC):
------------------------------
Definition:
Area under the ROC curve
AUC = ∫₀¹ TPR(FPR) d(FPR)

Probabilistic Interpretation:
AUC = P(score_positive > score_negative)
Probability that randomly chosen positive instance ranks higher than randomly chosen negative instance

Computational Methods:
Trapezoidal Rule:
AUC = Σᵢ (FPRᵢ₊₁ - FPRᵢ) × (TPRᵢ₊₁ + TPRᵢ) / 2

Mann-Whitney U Statistic:
AUC = U / (n_pos × n_neg)
where U is Mann-Whitney U statistic

4.4 AUC Properties and Interpretation:
-------------------------------------
Range and Interpretation:
- AUC = 0.5: Random classifier
- AUC = 1.0: Perfect classifier
- AUC = 0.0: Perfectly wrong classifier (can invert)
- AUC > 0.5: Better than random
- AUC < 0.5: Worse than random

Scale Independence:
AUC measures quality of predictions regardless of classification threshold
Threshold-independent metric

Class Imbalance:
AUC can be optimistic for severely imbalanced datasets
Maintains good properties under moderate imbalance

Statistical Properties:
- Consistent estimator of ranking quality
- Confidence intervals via bootstrap or DeLong method
- Hypothesis testing for comparing AUCs

4.5 Partial AUC:
---------------
Motivation:
Full AUC may not reflect performance in region of interest
Focus on clinically relevant FPR range

Definition:
pAUC = ∫_{FPR₁}^{FPR₂} TPR(FPR) d(FPR)

Normalization:
Standardized pAUC = (pAUC - min_pAUC) / (max_pAUC - min_pAUC)

Applications:
- Medical diagnosis: Low FPR region important
- Security: Focus on high sensitivity region
- Screening tests: Specific FPR constraints

4.6 Multi-class ROC:
-------------------
One-vs-Rest (OvR):
Create K binary problems
Plot separate ROC curve for each class

One-vs-One (OvO):
K(K-1)/2 binary problems
More complex interpretation

Macro-averaged ROC:
Average TPR and FPR across classes at each threshold
Simple extension to multi-class

Volume Under Surface (VUS):
3D extension of AUC for three-class problems
Harder to interpret and compute

4.7 Cost-Sensitive ROC Analysis:
-------------------------------
Cost Curves:
Transform ROC space to show expected cost
X-axis: probability cost function
Y-axis: normalized expected cost

Optimal Operating Point:
Point on ROC curve minimizing expected cost
Depends on class prior probabilities and misclassification costs

5. PRECISION-RECALL CURVES
==========================

5.1 PR Curve Fundamentals:
-------------------------
Precision-Recall (PR) Curve:

Varies classification threshold

Construction:
Similar to ROC curve but plot Precision vs Recall
Each threshold gives one (Recall, Precision) point

Baseline:
Random classifier baseline = fraction of positive class
Horizontal line at y = |P| / (|P| + |N|)

5.2 PR vs ROC Curves:
--------------------
When to Use PR Curves:
- Highly imbalanced datasets
- Positive class is more important
- Cost of false positives very high

Advantages of PR Curves:
- More informative for imbalanced data
- Focus on positive class performance
- Less optimistic than ROC for rare positive class

ROC Curve Advantages:
- Symmetric treatment of classes
- More stable across different class distributions
- Better theoretical properties

Example:
99% negative, 1% positive class
Perfect specificity (99% correct negatives) gives high AUC
But low precision if many false positives among few predictions

5.3 Area Under PR Curve:
-----------------------
Average Precision (AP):
AP = Σₙ (Rₙ - Rₙ₋₁) Pₙ
where Pₙ and Rₙ are precision and recall at n-th threshold

Interpolated AP:
Use step-wise interpolation
AP = Σᵣ P_interp(r) Δr

Relationship to AUC:
No simple relationship between PR-AUC and ROC-AUC
Can move in opposite directions with class imbalance

5.4 PR Curve Properties:
-----------------------
Monotonicity:
PR curves are not necessarily monotonic
Precision can increase or decrease as recall increases

Interpolation:
Lower convex hull often used
Represents achievable performance

Dominance:
Curve A dominates B if it's above B everywhere
Doesn't always translate to higher area

5.5 Break-Even Point:
--------------------
Definition:
Point where Precision = Recall
Single number summary of PR curve

Interpretation:
Balance between precision and recall
Equivalent to F1-score at that threshold

Limitations:
- May not exist on actual curve
- Requires interpolation
- May not reflect optimal operating point

5.6 Precision at K:
------------------
Definition:
Precision considering only top K predictions
P@K = (relevant items in top K) / K

Use Cases:
- Information retrieval: Top 10 search results
- Recommendation systems: Top N recommendations
- Medical diagnosis: High-confidence predictions

Advantages:
- Directly interpretable
- Reflects real-world constraints
- Easy to compute
