1. REGRESSION EVALUATION FUNDAMENTALS
=====================================

1.1 Regression Problem Setup:
----------------------------
Continuous Target Variable:
y ∈ ℝ (real-valued outcomes)
Examples: Price prediction, temperature forecasting, risk assessment

Prediction Types:
Point Predictions: Single value ŷ
Interval Predictions: [ŷ_lower, ŷ_upper]
Distributional Predictions: Full probability distribution

Error Definition:
Residual: eᵢ = yᵢ - ŷᵢ
Prediction error for observation i

Evaluation Objectives:
- Measure prediction accuracy
- Compare model performance
- Assess model assumptions
- Guide model selection
- Identify outliers and influential points

1.2 Types of Prediction Errors:
------------------------------
Bias:
Systematic over- or under-prediction
E[ŷ - y] ≠ 0

Variance:
Variability in predictions across different samples
Var[ŷ]

Noise:
Irreducible error from target variable uncertainty
E[(y - E[y])²]

Bias-Variance Decomposition:
MSE = Bias² + Variance + Noise

1.3 Scale-Dependent vs Scale-Independent:
----------------------------------------
Scale-Dependent Metrics:
Depend on units of measurement
Examples: MSE, MAE, RMSE
Useful for comparing models on same dataset

Scale-Independent Metrics:
Unitless measures
Examples: R², MAPE, correlation
Useful for comparing across different problems

Relative vs Absolute:
Absolute: Raw error magnitudes
Relative: Errors relative to baseline or true values

1.4 Symmetric vs Asymmetric Loss:
--------------------------------
Symmetric Loss:
Equal penalty for over- and under-prediction
Examples: MSE, MAE

Asymmetric Loss:
Different penalties for positive vs negative errors
Examples: Asymmetric MAE, quantile loss

Business Context:
- Inventory management: Different costs for over/under-stocking
- Financial forecasting: Asymmetric risk preferences
- Medical dosing: Safety considerations

1.5 Robust vs Non-Robust Metrics:
---------------------------------
Robust Metrics:
Less sensitive to outliers
Examples: MAE, median absolute error

Non-Robust Metrics:
Heavily influenced by outliers
Examples: MSE, RMSE

Outlier Sensitivity:
MSE gives quadratic penalty to large errors
MAE gives linear penalty to all errors

Trade-offs:
- Robust metrics: Stable but may miss important large errors
- Non-robust metrics: Sensitive to outliers but emphasize large errors

=======================================================

2. ERROR-BASED METRICS
======================

2.1 Mean Squared Error (MSE):
----------------------------
Definition:
MSE = (1/n) Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ (yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²

Properties:
- Always non-negative
- Units: [target variable]²
- Penalizes large errors more heavily
- Differentiable (useful for optimization)

Mathematical Properties:

Properties:
- Same units as target variable
- Geometric mean of errors
- Approximately standard deviation of residuals

Interpretation:
Typical prediction error magnitude
"On average, predictions are off by X units"

Relationship to Standard Deviation:
For unbiased predictions: RMSE ≈ σ_residuals

Advantages:
- Intuitive units
- Penalizes large errors
- Widely understood

Disadvantages:
- Still sensitive to outliers
- Non-linear aggregation of errors

Properties:
- Very robust to outliers
- Non-parametric measure
- 50th percentile of absolute errors

Use Cases:

Definition:
L_δ(y, ŷ) = {½(y - ŷ)²        if |y - ŷ| ≤ δ
            {δ|y - ŷ| - ½δ²   if |y - ŷ| > δ

Properties:

=======================================================

3. COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION (R²)
====================================

3.1 R² Definition and Interpretation:
------------------------------------
Formula:
R² = 1 - SS_res/SS_tot

where:
- SS_res = Σᵢ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)² (residual sum of squares)
- SS_tot = Σᵢ(yᵢ - ȳ)² (total sum of squares)

Alternative Formula:
R² = SS_reg/SS_tot

where SS_reg = Σᵢ(ŷᵢ - ȳ)² (regression sum of squares)

Interpretation:
Proportion of variance in target variable explained by model
R² = 0.8 means "model explains 80% of variance"

3.2 R² Properties:
-----------------
Range:
R² ∈ (-∞, 1]
- R² = 1: Perfect fit
- R² = 0: Model performs as well as mean prediction
- R² < 0: Model performs worse than mean

Relationship to Correlation:
For simple linear regression: R² = r²_{y,ŷ}
where r is Pearson correlation coefficient

Sample vs Population:
Sample R² typically overestimates population R²
Optimistic bias, especially with small samples

3.3 Adjusted R²:
---------------
Motivation:
R² always increases when adding variables
Need penalty for model complexity

Formula:
R²_adj = 1 - (1 - R²) × (n - 1)/(n - p - 1)

where:
- n = sample size
- p = number of predictors

Properties:
- Can decrease when adding irrelevant variables
- Penalizes overfitting
- More appropriate for model comparison

Interpretation:
Adjusted for degrees of freedom
More conservative than R²

3.4 Generalized R²:
------------------
Motivation:
Extend R² concept to other regression types
Non-linear models, GLMs, etc.

McFadden's Pseudo R²:
R²_McF = 1 - ln(L_M)/ln(L_0)
where L_M is model likelihood, L_0 is null model likelihood

Nagelkerke R²:
Normalized version of McFadden's R²
Range: [0, 1]

Efron's R²:
R²_Efron = 1 - Σᵢ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²/Σᵢ(yᵢ - ȳ)²
Generalization to any regression model

3.5 R² Limitations:
------------------
Non-Linear Relationships:
Low R² doesn't mean no relationship
May indicate non-linear patterns

Outlier Sensitivity:
Heavily influenced by outliers
Can be misleadingly high or low

Multiple Models:
R² alone insufficient for model selection
Need to consider other criteria

Causation vs Correlation:
High R² doesn't imply causation
May reflect spurious correlations

Sample Size Dependence:
Unstable for small samples
Need confidence intervals

3.6 Alternative Explained Variance Measures:
-------------------------------------------
Explained Variance Score:
EV = 1 - Var[y - ŷ]/Var[y]

Difference from R²:
Uses variance instead of sum of squares
May differ when predictions are biased

Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
r = Σᵢ(yᵢ - ȳ)(ŷᵢ - ȳ̂)/√(Σᵢ(yᵢ - ȳ)² × Σᵢ(ŷᵢ - ȳ̂)²)

Spearman Correlation:
Rank-based correlation
Robust to outliers and non-linear monotonic relationships

=======================================================

4. INFORMATION CRITERIA AND MODEL SELECTION
===========================================

4.1 Information Theory Background:
---------------------------------
Likelihood Function:
L(θ|data) = probability of observing data given parameters
Higher likelihood = better fit

Log-Likelihood:
ℓ(θ) = ln L(θ)
Easier to work with (sums instead of products)

Maximum Likelihood Estimation:
θ̂ = argmax_θ ℓ(θ)
Find parameters maximizing likelihood

Overfitting Problem:
More parameters always increase likelihood
Need penalty for complexity

4.2 Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):
--------------------------------------
Formula:
AIC = 2k - 2ℓ(θ̂)

where:
- k = number of parameters
- ℓ(θ̂) = log-likelihood at MLE

Interpretation:
Estimate of relative quality among models
Lower AIC indicates better model

Theoretical Foundation:
Asymptotic approximation to Kullback-Leibler divergence
Measures information loss

Model Selection:
Choose model with minimum AIC
Automatic trade-off between fit and complexity

4.3 Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):
----------------------------------------
Formula:
BIC = k ln(n) - 2ℓ(θ̂)

where n = sample size

Comparison with AIC:
- BIC penalizes complexity more heavily (ln(n) vs 2)
- BIC → consistent model selection as n → ∞
- AIC → optimal prediction performance

When to Use:
- BIC: When seeking true model
- AIC: When optimizing prediction
- Large n: BIC more conservative

Bayesian Interpretation:
Approximation to log marginal likelihood
Natural from Bayesian perspective

4.4 Corrected AIC (AICc):
------------------------
Motivation:
AIC biased for small samples
Need finite sample correction

Formula:
AICc = AIC + 2k(k+1)/(n-k-1)

When to Use:
n/k < 40 (small sample relative to parameters)
Always prefer AICc when applicable

Properties:
- AICc → AIC as n → ∞
- More conservative than AIC
- Better small sample properties

4.5 Deviance Information Criterion (DIC):
----------------------------------------
Bayesian Alternative:
DIC = p_D + D̄

where:
- D̄ = posterior mean deviance
- p_D = effective number of parameters

Effective Parameters:
p_D = D̄ - D(θ̄)
Accounts for parameter uncertainty

Use Cases:
- Bayesian models
- MCMC estimation
- Hierarchical models

4.6 Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC):
------------------------------------------------
Modern Bayesian Criterion:
WAIC = -2ℓ̂ + 2p_WAIC

where:
- ℓ̂ = log pointwise predictive density
- p_WAIC = effective number of parameters

Advantages:
- Fully Bayesian
- Works with singular models
- Better theoretical properties than DIC

Computation:
Requires posterior samples
More complex than AIC/BIC

4.7 Cross-Validation Information Criteria:
-----------------------------------------
Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation:
CV = (1/n)Σᵢ L(y_i, ŷ_{-i})

where ŷ_{-i} is prediction without observation i

Relationship to AIC:
Under certain conditions: AIC ≈ 2 × CV
AIC as approximation to LOO-CV

Generalized Cross-Validation:
GCV = n × MSE / (n - df)²
where df = degrees of freedom

Advantages:
- Model-agnostic
- Direct assessment of predictive performance
- Robust to model assumptions
