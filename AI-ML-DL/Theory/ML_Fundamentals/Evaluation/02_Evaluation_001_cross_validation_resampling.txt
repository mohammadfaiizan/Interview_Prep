1. MODEL EVALUATION FUNDAMENTALS
================================

1.1 The Evaluation Problem:
--------------------------
Model Performance Assessment:
Goal: Estimate how well model will perform on unseen data
Challenge: Limited data for training and testing

Bias-Variance in Evaluation:
- High bias: Overly pessimistic performance estimates
- High variance: Unstable estimates across different splits
- Goal: Balance bias and variance in evaluation

Data Splitting Strategies:
- Training set: Model learning
- Validation set: Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Test set: Final unbiased performance estimate

1.2 Sources of Evaluation Bias:
------------------------------
Selection Bias:
Non-representative train/test splits
Example: All positive samples in training set

Information Leakage:
Test data influences training process
Example: Feature selection on entire dataset

Overfitting to Validation Set:
Excessive hyperparameter tuning on validation data
Validation performance becomes optimistic

Temporal Leakage:
Future information used to predict past
Critical in time series and sequential data

1.3 Key Principles:
------------------
Independence:
Test data must be independent of training process
No information from test set should influence model

Representativeness:
Splits should represent target population
Maintain class distributions and data characteristics

Stability:
Evaluation should be robust to random variations
Multiple evaluations for confidence estimates

Computational Efficiency:
Balance between thorough evaluation and computational cost
Practical constraints in real-world applications

1.4 Evaluation Objectives:
-------------------------
Model Comparison:
Compare different algorithms or architectures
Statistical significance testing

Hyperparameter Optimization:
Find optimal model configuration
Avoid overfitting to validation data

Performance Estimation:
Unbiased estimate of generalization performance
Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification

Model Selection:
Choose best model among candidates
Consider performance-complexity trade-offs

1.5 Common Pitfalls:
-------------------
Data Snooping:
Repeated use of test set for decisions
Leads to optimistic performance estimates

Inadequate Sample Size:
Small datasets lead to high variance estimates
Need sufficient data for reliable evaluation

Ignoring Data Dependencies:
Treating dependent samples as independent
Important in time series, grouped data

Multiple Testing:
Testing many models without correction
Increases risk of false discoveries

=======================================================

2. CROSS-VALIDATION TECHNIQUES
==============================

2.1 K-Fold Cross-Validation:
---------------------------
Basic Algorithm:
1. Divide dataset into k equal-sized folds
2. For each fold i:
   a. Train on k-1 folds
   b. Test on fold i
3. Average performance across all folds

Mathematical Formulation:
CV_k = (1/k) Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ L(f^(-i), D_i)

where:
- f^(-i): model trained without fold i
- D_i: test fold i
- L: loss function

Advantages:
- Uses all data for both training and testing
- More stable than single train/test split
- Standard approach in machine learning

Disadvantages:
- Computationally expensive (k model fits)
- May have high variance for small k
- Biased for small datasets

2.2 Stratified K-Fold:
---------------------
Motivation:
Maintain class distribution in each fold
Important for imbalanced datasets

Algorithm:
1. For each class, divide samples into k groups
2. Create folds by combining one group from each class
3. Ensures each fold has same class proportions

Mathematical Property:
P(y = c | fold i) = P(y = c | entire dataset) ∀i, c

Benefits:
- Reduces variance in performance estimates
- Essential for highly imbalanced data
- More representative train/test splits

Implementation Considerations:
- Requires discrete class labels
- Extension to continuous targets via binning
- May not be perfectly balanced for small classes

2.3 Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV):
------------------------------------------
Special Case:
K-fold CV where k = n (sample size)
Each observation used as test set once

Algorithm:
1. For i = 1 to n:
   a. Train on all samples except xᵢ
   b. Test on xᵢ
2. Average performance across all n trials

LOOCV Estimate:
CV_n = (1/n) Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ L(f^(-i)(xᵢ), yᵢ)

Theoretical Properties:
- Nearly unbiased estimate of generalization error
- High variance due to highly correlated training sets
- Computationally expensive for large datasets

Analytical Solutions:
For certain models, LOOCV can be computed efficiently:

Linear Regression:
CV_n = (1/n) Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ (yᵢ - ŷᵢ / (1 - hᵢᵢ))²

where hᵢᵢ is i-th diagonal element of hat matrix

2.4 Leave-P-Out Cross-Validation:
--------------------------------
Generalization:
Leave p observations out for testing
More conservative than LOOCV

Computational Complexity:
Number of combinations: C(n,p) = n!/(p!(n-p)!)
Quickly becomes intractable for large p

Trade-offs:
- Larger p: More conservative, higher variance
- Smaller p: Less conservative, lower variance
- LOOCV is special case with p = 1

2.5 Repeated Cross-Validation:
-----------------------------
Motivation:
Reduce variance of CV estimate
Multiple random partitions

Algorithm:
1. Repeat k-fold CV multiple times with different random splits
2. Average performance across all repetitions

Benefits:
- More stable performance estimates
- Better confidence interval estimation
- Reduces impact of unlucky splits

Computational Cost:
If R repetitions: R × k model fits
Trade-off between stability and computation

2.6 Hold-Out Validation:
-----------------------
Simple Split:
Single random division into train/test sets
Typically 70-80% training, 20-30% testing

Three-Way Split:
Train/Validation/Test division
Example: 60%/20%/20% split

Advantages:
- Computationally efficient
- Simple to implement
- Clear separation of concerns

Disadvantages:
- High variance for small datasets
- Potential for unlucky splits
- Wastes data (some not used for training)

Monte Carlo Cross-Validation:
Repeated random splits
Average over multiple hold-out evaluations

=======================================================

3. BOOTSTRAP METHODS
====================

3.1 Bootstrap Principle:
-----------------------
Resampling with Replacement:
Create new datasets by sampling original data with replacement
Typically same size as original dataset

Bootstrap Sample:
B* = {x*₁, x*₂, ..., x*ₙ}
where x*ᵢ sampled uniformly from original dataset

Statistical Foundation:
Bootstrap distribution approximates sampling distribution
Enables inference without distributional assumptions

Applications:
- Confidence intervals
- Bias estimation
- Variance estimation
- Hypothesis testing

3.2 Bootstrap Validation:
------------------------
0.632 Bootstrap:
Accounts for optimism in apparent error rate

Bootstrap Error Estimate:
Err_boot = 0.368 × Err_train + 0.632 × Err_bootstrap

Derivation:
Probability of observation not selected in bootstrap sample:
P(not selected) = (1 - 1/n)ⁿ → 1/e ≈ 0.368 as n → ∞

Algorithm:
1. Generate B bootstrap samples
2. For each bootstrap sample b:
   a. Train model on bootstrap sample
   b. Test on out-of-bag observations
3. Average out-of-bag error rates

3.3 Out-of-Bag (OOB) Estimation:
-------------------------------
Natural Test Set:
Observations not selected in bootstrap sample
Approximately 36.8% of original data

OOB Error:
Err_OOB = (1/|OOB|) Σᵢ∈OOB L(f_B(xᵢ), yᵢ)

Advantages:
- No additional data splitting required
- Uses all data efficiently
- Natural for ensemble methods (Random Forest)

Variance Properties:
Lower variance than LOOCV
More stable than single hold-out

3.4 0.632+ Bootstrap:
--------------------
Improved Estimator:
Addresses overfitting in 0.632 bootstrap

Formula:
Err_632+ = (1-w) × Err_train + w × Err_bootstrap

Weight Calculation:
w = 0.632 / (1 - 0.368 × R)

where R is relative overfitting rate:
R = (Err_bootstrap - Err_train) / (γ - Err_train)
γ = no-information error rate

Benefits:
- Adapts to amount of overfitting
- More accurate for complex models
- Reduces optimism in difficult problems

3.5 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals:
----------------------------------
Percentile Method:
CI = [θ*_(α/2), θ*_(1-α/2)]
where θ*_(p) is p-th percentile of bootstrap distribution

Bias-Corrected (BC):
Adjusts for bias in bootstrap distribution
Useful when bootstrap distribution is skewed

BCa Method:
Bias-corrected and accelerated
Accounts for both bias and skewness

Student's t Bootstrap:
Uses standardized bootstrap statistics
Better coverage for symmetric distributions

3.6 Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing:
--------------------------------
Permutation Tests:
Test null hypothesis of no relationship
Randomly permute response variables

Bootstrap P-values:
P = (1 + #{θ*ᵦ ≥ θ_obs}) / (B + 1)

Two-Sample Bootstrap:
Compare two groups using bootstrap resampling
Test difference in means, medians, etc.

Advantages:
- Distribution-free methods
- Robust to outliers
- Handles complex statistics

=======================================================

4. SPECIALIZED RESAMPLING APPROACHES
====================================

----------------------------
Problem:
Data contains natural groups or clusters
Independence assumption violated within groups

Examples:
- Multiple observations per patient
- Longitudinal studies
- Hierarchical data structures

Group K-Fold:
Ensure all observations from same group in same fold
Maintains independence between train/test sets

Algorithm:
1. Identify unique groups
2. Randomly assign groups to folds
3. Train/test based on group assignments

4.2 Spatial Cross-Validation:
----------------------------
Spatial Autocorrelation:
Nearby observations tend to be similar
Standard CV overestimates performance

Spatial Blocking:
Create spatially separated train/test sets
Minimum distance between training and test points

Buffer Zones:
Remove observations within certain distance of test set
Reduces spatial autocorrelation effects

Environmental Modeling:
Critical for geographic and ecological data
Accounts for spatial dependence structure

4.3 Cluster-Based Cross-Validation:
----------------------------------
Pre-clustering:
Cluster data before cross-validation
Ensures clusters don't span train/test boundary

Cluster-wise Splits:
Assign entire clusters to folds
Maintains cluster integrity

Applications:
- Image patches from same image
- Text documents from same source
- Genomic data from related organisms

4.4 Adversarial Validation:
--------------------------
Domain Shift Detection:
Train classifier to distinguish train vs test data
High accuracy indicates domain shift

Algorithm:
1. Combine train and test features
2. Create binary labels (train=0, test=1)
3. Train classifier using cross-validation
4. AUC ≈ 0.5 indicates similar distributions

Applications:
- Competition datasets
- Transfer learning scenarios
- Distribution shift detection

4.5 Stratified Sampling for Regression:
--------------------------------------
Continuous Targets:
Cannot directly stratify continuous variables
Need binning or alternative approaches

Quantile-Based Stratification:
1. Divide target into quantile bins
2. Apply stratified sampling within bins
3. Maintains target distribution

Kernel Density Stratification:
Use kernel density estimation for stratification
More sophisticated than simple binning

Representative Sampling:
Ensure training set represents full target range
Important for extrapolation assessment

=======================================================

5. TIME SERIES CROSS-VALIDATION
===============================

5.1 Temporal Dependencies:
-------------------------
Non-IID Data:
Time series observations are dependent
Standard CV violates independence assumption

Information Leakage:
Using future to predict past
Creates unrealistic performance estimates

Stationarity:
Statistical properties may change over time
Model performance may degrade

5.2 Time Series Split:
---------------------
Forward Chaining:
Always train on past, test on future
Respects temporal ordering

Algorithm:

2. Train model on available history
3. Test on next time period
4. Expand training window and repeat

Rolling Window:

Useful for non-stationary series

Expanding Window:
Growing training set
Incorporates all historical information

5.3 Walk-Forward Analysis:
-------------------------

Systematic evaluation over time
Mimics real-world deployment

Anchored Walk-Forward:
Fixed start date, expanding end date
Training set grows over time

Rolling Walk-Forward:
Fixed window size
Training set slides through time

Multi-Step Ahead:
Test multiple forecast horizons
Assess performance degradation with horizon

5.4 Blocked Cross-Validation:
----------------------------
Temporal Blocks:
Create contiguous time blocks
Leave gaps between train/test

Gap Period:
Buffer between training and test
Reduces temporal leakage

Block Size Selection:
Balance between:
- Sufficient training data
- Realistic test scenarios
- Computational efficiency

5.5 Purged Cross-Validation:
---------------------------
Financial Time Series:
Account for label overlap
Remove observations with overlapping prediction windows

Purging:
Remove training observations that overlap with test period
Reduces look-ahead bias

Embargo:
Additional buffer period after purging
Accounts for market microstructure effects

Pipeline:
1. Standard time-based split
2. Purge overlapping observations
3. Apply embargo period

=======================================================

6. NESTED CROSS-VALIDATION
==========================

6.1 Model Selection Problem:
---------------------------
Hyperparameter Optimization:
Need separate validation for parameter tuning
Test set only for final evaluation

Biased Evaluation:
Using test set for model selection creates optimism
Need nested evaluation structure

Double Cross-Validation:
Outer loop: Performance estimation
Inner loop: Model selection

6.2 Nested CV Algorithm:
-----------------------
Two-Level Structure:
Outer CV: k₁-fold cross-validation for performance estimation
Inner CV: k₂-fold cross-validation for model selection

Algorithm:
```
for i = 1 to k₁:
    # Outer loop
    train_outer = all folds except i
    test_outer = fold i
    
    # Inner loop (on train_outer only)
    best_params = hyperparameter_optimization(train_outer, k₂-fold CV)
    
    # Train final model and evaluate
    model = train(train_outer, best_params)
    score_i = evaluate(model, test_outer)

final_score = average(score_1, ..., score_k₁)
```

6.3 Computational Complexity:
----------------------------
Model Fits:
Total fits = k₁ × (k₂ × n_params + 1)

Example:
- 5×5 nested CV with 100 parameter combinations
- Total: 5 × (5 × 100 + 1) = 2,505 model fits

Parallel Processing:
- Outer folds can be parallelized
- Inner hyperparameter search can be parallelized

Balance between training time and performance

Implementation:
- Inner CV determines optimal stopping point
- Outer CV uses this for final evaluation
- Prevents overfitting to validation set

6.6 Model Selection Strategies:
------------------------------
Best Model:
Select model with best inner CV performance
Risk of overfitting to inner CV

One Standard Error Rule:
Select simplest model within one SE of best
Promotes generalization over complexity

Pareto Frontier:
Consider multiple objectives (accuracy, complexity)
Select models on efficient frontier

Ensemble Selection:
Combine multiple good models
Often better than single best model

=======================================================

7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
=============================

7.1 Variance of CV Estimates:
----------------------------
Sources of Variance:
- Random data splitting
- Stochastic algorithms
- Small sample sizes

Theoretical Variance:
For k-fold CV with squared error loss:
Var(CV_k) = σ²/n + (k-1)/k × σ²_between

where σ²_between reflects between-fold variation

Bias-Variance Trade-off:
- Small k (e.g., 3): Low variance, high bias
- Large k (e.g., 10): High variance, low bias
- LOOCV: Highest variance

Optimal k Selection:
Common choices: k = 5 or k = 10
Balance computational cost and statistical properties

7.2 Confidence Intervals:
------------------------
Bootstrap Confidence Intervals:
Resample CV scores to estimate uncertainty
Percentile or BCa intervals

Analytical Approximations:

CI = CV ± t_(α/2) × SE(CV)

Standard Error Estimation:
SE(CV) = SD(CV scores) / √k
Assumes independence between folds

Corrected Variance:
Account for correlation between training sets
Nadeau-Bengio correction

7.3 Hypothesis Testing:
----------------------
Paired t-test:
Compare two models using same CV folds
Tests difference in paired scores

McNemar's Test:
For classification with matched pairs

Standardized effect size
d = (μ₁ - μ₂) / σ_pooled

Minimum Meaningful Difference:
Domain-specific threshold
Example: 1% accuracy improvement in medical diagnosis

Cost-Benefit Analysis:
Consider computational cost vs performance gain
ROI of model improvements

7.5 Sample Size Considerations:
------------------------------
Learning Curves:
Plot performance vs training set size
Assess if more data would help

Power Analysis:
