1. CONVOLUTION OPERATION FUNDAMENTALS
=====================================

1.1 Mathematical Foundation:
---------------------------
Discrete Convolution:
(f * g)[n] = ∑_{m=-∞}^{∞} f[m] g[n-m]

For finite signals:
(f * g)[n] = ∑_{m=0}^{M-1} f[m] g[n-m]

2D Discrete Convolution:
(I * K)[i,j] = ∑_{m=0}^{M-1} ∑_{n=0}^{N-1} I[i+m, j+n] K[m,n]

where:
- I: input image/feature map
- K: convolution kernel/filter
- *: convolution operator

Cross-Correlation (CNN Implementation):
(I ⊗ K)[i,j] = ∑_{m=0}^{M-1} ∑_{n=0}^{N-1} I[i+m, j+n] K[m,n]

Note: CNNs typically use cross-correlation, not true convolution

1.2 Convolution Properties:
--------------------------
Linearity:
(αf + βg) * h = α(f * h) + β(g * h)

Commutativity:
f * g = g * f

Associativity:
(f * g) * h = f * (g * h)

Translation Equivariance:
If f(x) → f(x + δ), then (f * g)(x) → (f * g)(x + δ)
Output shifts by same amount as input

Local Connectivity:
Each output depends only on local input region
Reduces parameters compared to fully connected

1.3 Multi-Channel Convolution:
-----------------------------
Input Tensor:
X ∈ ℝ^{H×W×C_{in}} where:
- H: height
- W: width  
- C_{in}: input channels

Kernel Tensor:
K ∈ ℝ^{K_H×K_W×C_{in}×C_{out}} where:
- K_H, K_W: kernel spatial dimensions
- C_{out}: number of output channels/filters

Output Computation:
Y[i,j,d] = ∑_{m=0}^{K_H-1} ∑_{n=0}^{K_W-1} ∑_{c=0}^{C_{in}-1} X[i+m, j+n, c] × K[m, n, c, d] + b[d]

Output Shape:
Y ∈ ℝ^{H_{out}×W_{out}×C_{out}}

1.4 Convolution Parameters:
--------------------------
Kernel Size:
- Common sizes: 1×1, 3×3, 5×5, 7×7
- Larger kernels: wider receptive field, more parameters
- Smaller kernels: fewer parameters, deeper networks needed

Stride:
- s=1: output size ≈ input size
- s>1: spatial downsampling
- H_{out} = ⌊(H_{in} - K_H + 2P)/s⌋ + 1

Padding:
- Valid: no padding (P=0)
- Same: output size = input size
- P = (K-1)/2 for same padding with stride 1

Dilation:
Dilated convolution with dilation rate r:
Y[i,j] = ∑_m ∑_n X[i+r·m, j+r·n] K[m,n]
Increases receptive field without adding parameters

1.5 Computational Complexity:
----------------------------
Direct Convolution:
O(H_{out} × W_{out} × C_{out} × K_H × K_W × C_{in})

Memory Requirements:
- Input: H_{in} × W_{in} × C_{in}
- Weights: K_H × K_W × C_{in} × C_{out}
- Output: H_{out} × W_{out} × C_{out}

Optimizations:

=======================================================

2. POOLING AND SPATIAL REDUCTION
=================================

2.1 Pooling Operations:
----------------------
Max Pooling:
Y[i,j] = max_{0≤m<K_H, 0≤n<K_W} X[s·i+m, s·j+n]

Average Pooling:
Y[i,j] = (1/(K_H × K_W)) ∑_{m=0}^{K_H-1} ∑_{n=0}^{K_W-1} X[s·i+m, s·j+n]

Global Average Pooling:
Y[c] = (1/(H×W)) ∑_{i=0}^{H-1} ∑_{j=0}^{W-1} X[i,j,c]

Global Max Pooling:
Y[c] = max_{0≤i<H, 0≤j<W} X[i,j,c]

2.2 Pooling Properties:
----------------------
Spatial Invariance:
Small translations in input don't change output
Provides robustness to spatial perturbations

Dimensionality Reduction:
Reduces spatial dimensions
Controls overfitting through information bottleneck

Parameter-Free:
No learnable parameters
Pure deterministic operation

Receptive Field:
Increases effective receptive field of subsequent layers
Each pooled unit represents larger input region

2.3 Adaptive Pooling:
--------------------
Adaptive Average Pooling:
Output size specified, kernel size computed
Useful for variable input sizes

Adaptive Max Pooling:
Similar to adaptive average but uses max operation

Fractional Max Pooling:
Randomized pooling regions
Provides regularization effect

Stochastic Pooling:
Sample from multinomial distribution based on activations
Combines benefits of max and average pooling

2.4 Alternative Pooling Methods:
-------------------------------
Lp Pooling:
Y[i,j] = (∑_{m,n} X[s·i+m, s·j+n]^p)^{1/p}
Generalizes max (p→∞) and average (p=1) pooling

Spatial Pyramid Pooling:
Multiple pooling at different scales
Handles variable input sizes

Mixed Pooling:
Learnable combination of max and average
α·max_pool + (1-α)·avg_pool where α is learned

Attention-Based Pooling:
Weighted pooling with learned attention weights
More flexible than fixed pooling patterns

2.5 Pooling vs Strided Convolution:
----------------------------------
Strided Convolution:
Achieves downsampling with learnable parameters
Can replace pooling in modern architectures

Benefits of Strided Convolution:
- Learnable downsampling
- Preserves more information
- End-to-end differentiable

Benefits of Pooling:
- Parameter-free
- Explicit spatial invariance

=======================================================

3. CNN ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS
==============================

3.1 Convolutional Layers:
------------------------
Standard Convolution:
Conv2D(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding)

Batch Normalization:
Normalizes layer inputs for stable training
Applied after convolution, before activation

Activation Function:
- ReLU: Most common for hidden layers
- Leaky ReLU: Prevents dying neurons
- Swish/GELU: Modern alternatives

Dropout:
Randomly sets activations to zero during training
Regularization technique

Layer Composition:
Common pattern: Conv → BatchNorm → ReLU → (Dropout)

3.2 Feature Map Progression:
---------------------------
Spatial Dimensions:
Typically decrease through network
High resolution → Low resolution

Channel Dimensions:
Typically increase through network
Few channels → Many channels

Receptive Field:
Grows with network depth
Early layers: local features
Deep layers: global features

Information Flow:
Spatial detail → Semantic information
Low-level features → High-level concepts

3.3 Architectural Patterns:
--------------------------
Feature Extraction:
Convolution + Pooling blocks
Extract hierarchical features

Classification Head:
Global pooling + Fully connected layers
Map features to class probabilities

Bottleneck Design:
1×1 → 3×3 → 1×1 convolution
Reduces computational cost

Residual Connections:
Skip connections for gradient flow
Enable very deep networks

3.4 Network Depth Considerations:
--------------------------------
Shallow Networks:
- Simple features only
- Limited representational power
- Fast training and inference

Deep Networks:
- Hierarchical feature learning
- Better representational capacity
- Require careful design for training

Depth vs Width:
- Depth: Hierarchical representations
- Width: Parallel feature extraction

=======================================================

4. PARAMETER SHARING AND TRANSLATION INVARIANCE
===============================================

4.1 Parameter Sharing Concept:
-----------------------------
Weight Sharing:
Same kernel applied across spatial locations
Dramatically reduces parameters

Mathematical Expression:
Y[i,j] uses same weights K for all (i,j)
vs fully connected: separate weights for each connection

Parameter Count Comparison:
- Fully connected: H×W×C_in × H×W×C_out
- Convolutional: K_H×K_W×C_in×C_out

Example:
32×32×3 input to 32×32×64 output:
- FC: 32×32×3 × 32×32×64 = 201M parameters
- Conv 3×3: 3×3×3×64 = 1.7K parameters

4.2 Translation Invariance:
--------------------------
Definition:
f(T_δ x) = T_δ f(x) where T_δ is translation by δ

In Practice:
Object detection works regardless of position
Features learned are location-independent

Approximate Invariance:
CNNs have translation equivariance
Pooling provides approximate invariance

Limitations:
- Boundary effects
- Finite spatial extent
- Discrete sampling

4.3 Equivariance vs Invariance:
------------------------------
Translation Equivariance:
Input translation → corresponding output translation
Convolution is naturally equivariant

Translation Invariance:
Input translation → same output
Achieved through pooling or global operations

Other Symmetries:
- Rotation: typically not preserved
- Scale: partially addressed by multi-scale processing
- Reflection: data augmentation helps

Design Implications:
Choose architecture based on desired invariances
Balance between specificity and generalization

4.4 Receptive Field Analysis:
----------------------------
Local Receptive Field:
Initial layers see small spatial regions
Grows with network depth

Effective Receptive Field:
Not all pixels in theoretical RF contribute equally
Central pixels have higher influence

Calculation:
RF_l = RF_{l-1} + (K_l - 1) × ∏_{i=1}^{l-1} S_i

where K_l is kernel size, S_i is stride at layer i

Design Considerations:
Ensure RF covers relevant spatial context
Balance between local and global information
