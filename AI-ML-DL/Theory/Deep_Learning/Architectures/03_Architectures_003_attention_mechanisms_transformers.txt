=======================================================

1. ATTENTION MECHANISM FUNDAMENTALS
===================================

1.1 Motivation for Attention:
-----------------------------
Information Bottleneck Problem:
Traditional seq2seq models compress entire input sequence into fixed-size vector
Long sequences lose information in bottleneck

Alignment Problem:
Different parts of input relevant for different outputs
Need dynamic focusing mechanism

Context Selection:
Not all input positions equally important for each output
Attention allows selective information access

Parallelization:
RNNs inherently sequential, limiting parallelization
Attention enables parallel computation

1.2 Attention Intuition:
-----------------------
Human Attention Analogy:
When reading, we focus on relevant words/phrases
Attention mimics this selective focus mechanism

Query-Key-Value Paradigm:
- Query: What information are we looking for?
- Key: What information is available?
- Value: The actual information content

Similarity-Based Weighting:
Compute similarity between query and keys
Use similarity scores to weight values

Dynamic Context:
Context vector changes based on current query
Adaptive information selection

1.3 Mathematical Framework:
--------------------------
General Attention Function:
Attention(Q, K, V) = ∑ᵢ αᵢVᵢ

where:
- Q: Query vector
- K = [K₁, K₂, ..., Kₙ]: Key vectors
- V = [V₁, V₂, ..., Vₙ]: Value vectors
- α = [α₁, α₂, ..., αₙ]: Attention weights

Attention Weights:
αᵢ = softmax(score(Q, Kᵢ))
αᵢ = exp(score(Q, Kᵢ)) / ∑ⱼ exp(score(Q, Kⱼ))

Score Functions:
- Dot product: score(Q, K) = QᵀK
- Scaled dot product: score(Q, K) = QᵀK/√d
- Additive: score(Q, K) = vᵀtanh(WQ + UK)
- Bilinear: score(Q, K) = QᵀWK

1.4 Types of Attention:
----------------------
Global vs Local Attention:
- Global: Attend to all positions
- Local: Attend to subset of positions

Soft vs Hard Attention:
- Soft: Weighted combination of all positions
- Hard: Select single position (non-differentiable)

Self-Attention:
Query, key, and value come from same sequence
Intra-sequence dependencies

Cross-Attention:
Query from one sequence, keys/values from another
Inter-sequence dependencies

1.5 Advantages of Attention:
---------------------------
Variable Context Length:
Can handle sequences of any length
No fixed-size bottleneck

Interpretability:
Attention weights show model focus
Provides insight into decision making

Parallelization:
Can compute all attention weights simultaneously
Much faster than sequential RNNs

Long-Range Dependencies:
Direct connections between distant positions
No vanishing gradient through time

=======================================================

2. SELF-ATTENTION AND SCALED DOT-PRODUCT ATTENTION
==================================================

2.1 Self-Attention Concept:
--------------------------
Definition:
Each position in sequence attends to all positions
Including itself (hence "self"-attention)

Mathematical Formulation:
For input sequence X = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ]:
Q = XWQ, K = XWK, V = XWV

Self-Attention(X) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

Benefits:
- Captures intra-sequence dependencies
- Enables parallel computation
- Direct modeling of long-range interactions

2.2 Scaled Dot-Product Attention:
--------------------------------
Formula:
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

where:
- Q ∈ ℝᴺˣᵈᵏ: Query matrix
- K ∈ ℝᴹˣᵈᵏ: Key matrix  
- V ∈ ℝᴹˣᵈᵛ: Value matrix
- dₖ: Dimension of key/query vectors

Scaling Factor:
√dₖ prevents softmax saturation for large dimensions
Without scaling: dot products grow with dimension
Large dot products → sharp softmax → vanishing gradients

Step-by-Step Computation:
1. Compute QKᵀ (similarity scores)
2. Scale by 1/√dₖ
3. Apply softmax row-wise
4. Multiply by V to get output

2.3 Implementation Details:
--------------------------
Matrix Dimensions:
- Input: N × d (N positions, d features)
- Q, K: N × dₖ (after linear projection)
- V: N × dᵥ (after linear projection)
- Output: N × dᵥ

Linear Projections:
Q = XWQ where WQ ∈ ℝᵈˣᵈᵏ
K = XWK where WK ∈ ℝᵈˣᵈᵏ
V = XWV where WV ∈ ℝᵈˣᵈᵛ

Computational Complexity:
- Time: O(N²dₖ + Ndₖdᵥ)
- Space: O(N² + Ndᵥ)
- Quadratic in sequence length

2.4 Masking in Attention:
------------------------
Padding Mask:
Ignore padded positions in variable-length sequences
Set attention scores to -∞ before softmax

Look-Ahead Mask:
Prevent attention to future positions
Used in decoder for causal modeling

Implementation:
```python
# Padding mask
scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)

# Causal mask (lower triangular)
mask = torch.triu(torch.ones(seq_len, seq_len), diagonal=1)
scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 1, -1e9)
```

2.5 Attention Patterns:
---------------------
Local Attention:
Each position attends primarily to nearby positions
Sparse attention patterns

Global Attention:
Some positions attend to all other positions
Dense attention patterns

Head-specific Patterns:
Different attention heads learn different patterns
Syntactic, semantic, positional relationships

Interpretability:
Attention weights visualizable as heatmaps
Provides insights into model behavior

=======================================================

3. MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION
=======================

3.1 Multi-Head Motivation:
--------------------------
Representation Subspaces:
Single attention head focuses on one type of relationship
Multiple heads capture different aspects

Analogous to CNN Filters:
Different filters detect different features
Different heads attend to different relationships

Increased Model Capacity:
More parameters for learning complex patterns
Richer representation learning

Ensemble Effect:
Multiple heads provide diverse perspectives
Improved robustness and performance

3.2 Multi-Head Architecture:
---------------------------
Mathematical Definition:
MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head₁, head₂, ..., headₕ)WO

where:
headᵢ = Attention(QWᵢQ, KWᵢK, VWᵢV)

Parameter Matrices:
- WᵢQ ∈ ℝᵈᵐᵒᵈᵉˡˣᵈᵏ: Query projection for head i
- WᵢK ∈ ℝᵈᵐᵒᵈᵉˡˣᵈᵏ: Key projection for head i
- WᵢV ∈ ℝᵈᵐᵒᵈᵉˡˣᵈᵛ: Value projection for head i
- WO ∈ ℝʰᵈᵛˣᵈᵐᵒᵈᵉˡ: Output projection

Dimension Settings:
Typically: dₖ = dᵥ = dₘₒdₑₗ/h
Total parameters similar to single large head

3.3 Implementation:
------------------
Efficient Computation:
Reshape operations to batch heads together
Single matrix multiplication for all heads

PyTorch Implementation:
```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads
        
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        
    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None):
        batch_size, seq_len = query.size(0), query.size(1)
        
        # Linear projections in batch from d_model => h x d_k
        Q = self.W_q(query).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        K = self.W_k(key).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        V = self.W_v(value).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        
        # Apply attention
        attention_output = scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask)
        
        # Concatenate heads and put through final linear layer
        attention_output = attention_output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(
            batch_size, seq_len, self.d_model)
        
        return self.W_o(attention_output)
```

4. TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE
===========================

4.1 Overall Architecture:
------------------------
Encoder-Decoder Structure:
- Encoder: Processes input sequence
- Decoder: Generates output sequence
- Attention connects encoder and decoder

Stack of Identical Layers:
- 6 layers in original Transformer
- Each layer has two sub-layers

Encoder Layer Components:
1. Multi-head self-attention
2. Position-wise feed-forward network
3. Residual connections + layer normalization

Decoder Layer Components:
1. Masked multi-head self-attention
2. Multi-head cross-attention (encoder-decoder)
3. Position-wise feed-forward network
4. Residual connections + layer normalization

4.2 Encoder Architecture:
------------------------
Input Processing:
Input Embeddings + Positional Encoding

Layer Structure:
```
for each of 6 layers:
    x = LayerNorm(x + MultiHeadAttention(x, x, x))
    x = LayerNorm(x + FeedForward(x))
```

Self-Attention in Encoder:
All positions can attend to all positions
Bidirectional context modeling

Feed-Forward Network:
FFN(x) = max(0, xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂
Two linear transformations with ReLU

Residual Connections:
Help with gradient flow
Enable training of deep networks

4.3 Decoder Architecture:
-------------------------
Autoregressive Generation:
Generate tokens one at a time
Each token depends on previous tokens

Masked Self-Attention:
Prevents attending to future positions
Maintains causal ordering

Cross-Attention:
Decoder attends to encoder outputs
Connects input and output sequences

Training vs Inference:
- Training: Teacher forcing with masking
- Inference: Sequential generation

4.4 Layer Normalization:
-----------------------
Pre-Norm vs Post-Norm:
Original: Post-norm (LayerNorm after residual)
Modern: Often Pre-norm (LayerNorm before sub-layer)

Pre-Norm Benefits:
- Better gradient flow
- More stable training
- Enables deeper networks

Implementation:
```python
# Post-norm (original)
x = LayerNorm(x + SubLayer(x))

# Pre-norm (modern)
x = x + SubLayer(LayerNorm(x))
```

4.5 Position-wise Feed-Forward:
------------------------------
Architecture:
Two linear layers with ReLU activation
FFN(x) = max(0, xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂

Dimensions:
- d_model = 512 (input/output dimension)
- d_ff = 2048 (inner dimension)
- 4x expansion then compression

Purpose:
- Add non-linearity
- Process each position independently
- Increase model capacity

Modern Variants:

- SwiGLU (Swish-Gated Linear Units)
- GeGLU (GELU-Gated Linear Units)

=======================================================

5. POSITION ENCODING AND EMBEDDINGS
===================================

5.1 Need for Position Information:
---------------------------------
Attention is Permutation Invariant:
Self-attention treats input as set, not sequence
Same result regardless of token order

Sequence Order Matters:
"I love dogs" ≠ "dogs love I"
Need way to inject positional information

Solution Approaches:
1. Positional encoding (added to embeddings)
2. Positional embeddings (learned)
3. Relative position encoding

5.2 Sinusoidal Position Encoding:
--------------------------------
Formula:
PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))

where:
- pos: position in sequence
- i: dimension index
- d_model: model dimension

Properties:
- Deterministic (no learned parameters)
- Different frequency for each dimension
- Can extrapolate to longer sequences
- PE(pos+k) can be computed from PE(pos)

Geometric Interpretation:
Each position mapped to point on unit circle
Different dimensions use different frequencies

5.3 Learned Position Embeddings:
-------------------------------
Approach:
Learn embedding for each position
PE = Embedding(position_id)

Advantages:
- Adaptive to data
- Can learn task-specific patterns
- Often performs better empirically

Disadvantages:
- Limited to maximum training length
- Cannot extrapolate to longer sequences
- Requires more parameters

Hybrid Approaches:
Combine sinusoidal and learned embeddings
Best of both worlds

5.4 Relative Position Encoding:
------------------------------
Motivation:
Absolute position less important than relative position
"Subject verb object" regardless of sentence position

Relative Position Bias:
Modify attention scores based on relative distance
score(qi, kj) = qiᵀkj + relative_bias(i-j)

Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE):
Multiply query/key by rotation matrices
Naturally encodes relative positions

Alibi (Attention with Linear Biases):
Add linear bias to attention scores
No position embeddings needed

5.5 Implementation Details:
--------------------------
Adding Position Encoding:
input_embeddings + position_encoding

Scaling:
Often scale embeddings by √d_model
Balances embedding and position magnitudes

Broadcasting:
Position encoding same for all examples in batch
Broadcast across batch dimension

```python
class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, max_len=5000):
        super().__init__()
        pe = torch.zeros(max_len, d_model)
        position = torch.arange(0, max_len).unsqueeze(1).float()
        
        div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() *
                           -(math.log(10000.0) / d_model))
        
        pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
        pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
        
        self.register_buffer('pe', pe.unsqueeze(0))
        
    def forward(self, x):
        return x + self.pe[:, :x.size(1)]
```
