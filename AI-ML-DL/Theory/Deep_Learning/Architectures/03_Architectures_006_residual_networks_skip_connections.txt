=======================================================

1. SKIP CONNECTION FUNDAMENTALS
===============================

1.1 Motivation and Background:
-----------------------------
Deep Network Training Problems:
Traditional deep networks suffer from degradation problem
Adding layers hurts performance even on training data
Not due to overfitting but optimization difficulty

Vanishing Gradient Problem:
Gradients become exponentially small in early layers
∂L/∂θ ∝ ∏ᵢ ∂hᵢ/∂hᵢ₋₁
Product of derivatives can vanish

Identity Mapping Hypothesis:
If deeper networks can perform at least as well as shallow ones
Should be able to learn identity mapping for extra layers

Historical Context:
Skip connections inspired by biological neural networks
Long-range connections common in brain architecture

1.2 Skip Connection Concept:
---------------------------
Mathematical Definition:
y = F(x, {Wᵢ}) + x

where:
- x: input to residual block
- F(x, {Wᵢ}): residual mapping
- y: output of residual block

Key Insight:
Instead of learning H(x) directly
Learn residual F(x) = H(x) - x
Then H(x) = F(x) + x

1.3 Types of Skip Connections:
-----------------------------
Identity Shortcuts:
Direct connection without transformation
y = F(x) + x

Projection Shortcuts:
Linear transformation when dimensions differ
y = F(x) + Wₛx

1×1 Convolutions:
Common projection method
Ws ∈ ℝᶜᵒᵘᵗˣᶜⁱⁿ

Zero Padding:
Alternative for dimension matching
Pad with zeros to match channels

1.4 Benefits of Skip Connections:
--------------------------------
Gradient Flow:
Direct path for gradients to flow backward
∂y/∂x = ∂F(x)/∂x + 1

Identity Preservation:
Network can learn identity mapping easily
F(x) = 0 gives perfect identity

Training Ease:
Easier to optimize residual mapping
Small perturbations around identity

Depth Enablement:
Allows training of very deep networks
100+ layers become feasible

1.5 Theoretical Analysis:
------------------------
Loss Landscape:
Skip connections create more favorable loss landscape
Multiple paths for optimization

Ensemble Perspective:
Residual networks as ensemble of shallow networks
Exponential number of paths through network

Optimization Theory:
Better conditioning of optimization problem
Reduced variance in gradient estimates

Function Composition:
Hierarchical feature learning preserved
Each block refines previous representation

Basic Building Block:
```
x → [Conv 3×3] → [BN] → [ReLU] → [Conv 3×3] → [BN] → (+) → [ReLU] → y
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Mathematical Formulation:
y = F(x, {W₁, W₂}) + x
F(x) = W₂ σ(BN(W₁ σ(BN(x))))

Where σ is ReLU activation, BN is batch normalization

Bottleneck Block:
For deeper networks (ResNet-50+)
```

```

3. HIGHWAY NETWORKS
===================

3.1 Highway Network Concept:
----------------------------
Gating Mechanism:
Adaptive combination of transformation and identity
y = H(x) ⊙ T(x) + x ⊙ C(x)

where:
- H(x): transformation function
- T(x): transform gate
- C(x): carry gate
- ⊙: element-wise multiplication

Simplified Form:
Often C(x) = 1 - T(x)
y = H(x) ⊙ T(x) + x ⊙ (1 - T(x))

Transform Gate:
T(x) = σ(Wₜx + bₜ)
Controls how much transformation to apply

3.2 Mathematical Analysis:
-------------------------
Gate Behavior:
- T(x) ≈ 0: y ≈ x (identity mapping)
- T(x) ≈ 1: y ≈ H(x) (full transformation)
- T(x) ≈ 0.5: y ≈ 0.5H(x) + 0.5x (balanced)

Gradient Flow:
∂y/∂x = ∂H/∂x ⊙ T + H ⊙ ∂T/∂x + (1 - T) - x ⊙ ∂T/∂x
≈ ∂H/∂x ⊙ T + (1 - T) when ∂T/∂x ≈ 0

Information Flow:
Always at least one path for information
Either through transformation or identity

3.3 Highway vs Residual:
-----------------------
Similarities:
Both enable deep network training
Both provide identity paths

Differences:
Highway: Learned gating (adaptive)
ResNet: Fixed identity addition (simpler)

Computational Cost:
Highway: Extra parameters for gates
ResNet: No additional parameters for shortcuts

Empirical Results:
ResNet generally outperforms Highway
Simpler structure often better

3.4 Highway Network Architecture:
--------------------------------

    def __init__(self, size):
        super().__init__()
        self.transform = nn.Linear(size, size)
        self.gate = nn.Linear(size, size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        t = torch.sigmoid(self.gate(x))
        h = torch.relu(self.transform(x))
        return h * t + x * (1 - t)
```
