=======================================================

1. GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK FUNDAMENTALS
====================================

1.1 Motivation for Graph Learning:
---------------------------------
Ubiquity of Graph Data:
- Social networks (user connections)
- Molecular structures (atom bonds)
- Knowledge graphs (entity relationships)
- Transportation networks (road/transit systems)
- Brain networks (neural connections)

Limitations of Traditional Networks:
CNNs assume grid structure (images)
RNNs assume sequential structure (text)
Fully connected networks ignore structure

Non-Euclidean Data:
Graphs don't have fixed topology
Variable number of neighbors per node
No natural ordering of nodes

Need for Permutation Invariance:
Graph representation should be invariant to node ordering
f(G) = f(π(G)) for any permutation π

1.2 Graph Representation:
------------------------
Graph Definition:
G = (V, E) where:
- V = {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ}: set of nodes
- E ⊆ V × V: set of edges

Adjacency Matrix:
A ∈ ℝⁿˣⁿ where Aᵢⱼ = 1 if (vᵢ, vⱼ) ∈ E

Node Features:
X ∈ ℝⁿˣᵈ where Xᵢ is feature vector for node i

Edge Features:
E ∈ ℝᵐˣᵈᵉ where Eᵢ is feature vector for edge i

Degree Matrix:
D ∈ ℝⁿˣⁿ where Dᵢᵢ = ∑ⱼ Aᵢⱼ (node degree)

1.3 Graph Learning Tasks:
------------------------
Node-Level Tasks:
- Node classification (predict node labels)
- Node regression (predict node properties)
- Node clustering/community detection

Edge-Level Tasks:
- Link prediction (predict missing edges)
- Edge classification (classify edge types)
- Relationship extraction

Graph-Level Tasks:
- Graph classification (classify entire graphs)
- Graph regression (predict graph properties)
- Graph generation/synthesis

Subgraph-Level Tasks:
- Subgraph matching
- Motif detection
- Community detection

1.4 Message Passing Framework:
-----------------------------
General Framework:
Most GNNs follow message passing paradigm
Nodes exchange information with neighbors
Update node representations iteratively

Three Phases:
1. Message: mᵢⱼ⁽ˡ⁾ = M⁽ˡ⁾(hᵢ⁽ˡ⁻¹⁾, hⱼ⁽ˡ⁻¹⁾, eᵢⱼ)
2. Aggregate: aᵢ⁽ˡ⁾ = A⁽ˡ⁾({mᵢⱼ⁽ˡ⁾ : j ∈ N(i)})
3. Update: hᵢ⁽ˡ⁾ = U⁽ˡ⁾(hᵢ⁽ˡ⁻¹⁾, aᵢ⁽ˡ⁾)

where:
- M⁽ˡ⁾: message function
- A⁽ˡ⁾: aggregation function
- U⁽ˡ⁾: update function
- N(i): neighbors of node i

1.5 Challenges in Graph Learning:
--------------------------------
Scalability:
Large graphs (millions of nodes)
Computational complexity issues

Over-squashing:
Information from distant nodes gets compressed
Limited expressiveness for long-range dependencies

Over-smoothing:
Node representations become too similar
Loss of local structure information

Dynamic Graphs:
Graphs change over time
Need to handle temporal evolution

Heterogeneous Graphs:

=======================================================

2. GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS (GCN)
=====================================

------------------------------
Graph Laplacian:
L = D - A (combinatorial Laplacian)
L̃ = D⁻¹/²LD⁻¹/² (normalized Laplacian)

Eigendecomposition:
L̃ = UΛUᵀ where:
- U: eigenvector matrix
- Λ: eigenvalue matrix

Spectral Filtering:
ĝ * x = Ug_θ(Λ)Uᵀx
where g_θ(Λ) is filter in spectral domain

Chebyshev Approximation:
g_θ(Λ) ≈ ∑ₖ₌₀ᴷ θₖTₖ(Λ̃)
where Tₖ is Chebyshev polynomial

2.2 Simplified GCN:
------------------
First-Order Approximation:
K = 1, λₘₐₓ ≈ 2
g_θ(Λ) ≈ θ₀I + θ₁Λ̃

Renormalization:
θ = θ₀ = -θ₁
Z = θ(I + D⁻¹/²AD⁻¹/²)X

Final Form:
Z = D̃⁻¹/²ÃD̃⁻¹/²XW
where Ã = A + I, D̃ᵢᵢ = ∑ⱼÃᵢⱼ

Layer-wise Propagation:
H⁽ˡ⁺¹⁾ = σ(D̃⁻¹/²ÃD̃⁻¹/²H⁽ˡ⁾W⁽ˡ⁾)

2.4 Multi-layer GCN:
-------------------

H⁽⁰⁾ = X
H⁽ˡ⁺¹⁾ = σ(ÃH⁽ˡ⁾W⁽ˡ⁾)
where Ã = D̃⁻¹/²ÃD̃⁻¹/²

Depth Limitations:

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        for i, conv in enumerate(self.convs):
