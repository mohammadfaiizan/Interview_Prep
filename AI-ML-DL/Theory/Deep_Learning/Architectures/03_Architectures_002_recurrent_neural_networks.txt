1. RNN FUNDAMENTALS AND MOTIVATION
==================================

1.1 Sequential Data Characteristics:
-----------------------------------
Temporal Dependencies:
Information at time t depends on previous times t-1, t-2, ...
Examples: Language, speech, time series, video

Variable Length Sequences:
Unlike fixed-size inputs, sequences have varying lengths
Need architectures that handle arbitrary sequence lengths

Order Matters:
Permuting sequence elements changes meaning
"The cat sat on the mat" ≠ "The mat sat on the cat"

Context Information:
Current prediction depends on historical context
Need memory to store relevant past information

1.2 Limitations of Feed-Forward Networks:
----------------------------------------
Fixed Input Size:
Dense layers require fixed-dimensional inputs
Cannot handle variable-length sequences directly

No Memory:
Each prediction independent of others
Cannot model temporal dependencies

Parameter Explosion:
Separate parameters for each time step
Doesn't scale to long sequences

Lack of Translation Invariance:
Features at different time steps use different parameters
Cannot generalize across time

1.3 RNN Design Principles:
-------------------------
Parameter Sharing:
Same parameters used at all time steps
Enables generalization across time

Hidden State:
Maintains information across time steps
Acts as memory for the network

Recurrent Connections:
Output at time t feeds back as input at time t+1
Creates temporal dynamics

Flexible Architecture:
Can handle variable-length sequences
Many-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many mappings

1.4 Types of RNN Mappings:
-------------------------
One-to-One:
Traditional neural network
Fixed input → Fixed output

One-to-Many:
Single input → Sequence output
Example: Image captioning

Many-to-One:
Sequence input → Single output
Example: Sentiment classification

Many-to-Many (Synced):
Sequence input → Sequence output (same length)
Example: Part-of-speech tagging

Many-to-Many (Async):
Sequence input → Sequence output (different length)
Example: Machine translation

1.5 Mathematical Notation:
-------------------------
Sequence Input:
X = (x₁, x₂, ..., xₜ) where xₜ ∈ ℝᵈ

Hidden States:
H = (h₁, h₂, ..., hₜ) where hₜ ∈ ℝʰ

Output Sequence:
Y = (y₁, y₂, ..., yₜ) where yₜ ∈ ℝᵒ

Time Index:
t ∈ {1, 2, ..., T} where T is sequence length

=======================================================

2. VANILLA RNN ARCHITECTURE
===========================

2.1 Basic RNN Formulation:
--------------------------
Hidden State Update:
hₜ = f(Wₓₕxₜ + Wₕₕhₜ₋₁ + bₕ)

Output Computation:
yₜ = g(Wₕᵧhₜ + bᵧ)

where:
- Wₓₕ ∈ ℝʰˣᵈ: input-to-hidden weight matrix
- Wₕₕ ∈ ℝʰˣʰ: hidden-to-hidden weight matrix
- Wₕᵧ ∈ ℝᵒˣʰ: hidden-to-output weight matrix
- bₕ, bᵧ: bias vectors
- f, g: activation functions (typically tanh, softmax)

Initial Hidden State:
h₀ = 0 or learned parameter

2.2 Computational Graph:
-----------------------
Unfolded Network:
RNN can be "unfolded" in time
Creates deep feedforward network

Forward Pass:
For t = 1 to T:
    hₜ = tanh(Wₓₕxₜ + Wₕₕhₜ₋₁ + bₕ)
    yₜ = softmax(Wₕᵧhₜ + bᵧ)

Shared Parameters:
Same weight matrices used at all time steps
Parameter sharing enables temporal generalization

2.3 Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):
---------------------------------------
Gradient Computation:
∂L/∂Wₕₕ = Σₜ ∂Lₜ/∂Wₕₕ

Chain Rule Application:
∂Lₜ/∂hₜ₋ₖ = ∂Lₜ/∂hₜ × ∏ⱼ₌₀ᵏ⁻¹ ∂hₜ₋ⱼ/∂hₜ₋ⱼ₋₁

Vanishing Gradient Problem:
∂hₜ/∂hₜ₋₁ = Wₕₕᵀ diag(f'(·))

If ||Wₕₕᵀ diag(f'(·))|| < 1, gradients vanish exponentially

Exploding Gradient Problem:
If ||Wₕₕᵀ diag(f'(·))|| > 1, gradients explode exponentially

2.4 Activation Functions:
------------------------
Tanh:
tanh(x) = (eˣ - e⁻ˣ)/(eˣ + e⁻ˣ)
- Range: (-1, 1)
- Zero-centered
- Saturates for large |x|

ReLU:
ReLU(x) = max(0, x)
- Helps with vanishing gradients
- Can cause exploding gradients
- Dead neurons for negative inputs

Sigmoid:
σ(x) = 1/(1 + e⁻ˣ)
- Range: (0, 1)
- Severe vanishing gradient problem
- Rarely used in hidden layers

2.5 Limitations of Vanilla RNN:
------------------------------
Vanishing Gradients:
Cannot learn long-term dependencies
Information decays exponentially with distance

Short-term Memory:
Recent inputs dominate hidden state
Difficulty retaining information over long sequences

Requires careful initialization and learning rates

Limited Capacity:
Simple gating mechanism
Cannot selectively remember/forget information

Sequential Computation:
Cannot be parallelized across time steps
Slow training and inference

=======================================================

3. LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM)
================================

3.1 LSTM Motivation:
-------------------
Address Vanishing Gradients:
Gating mechanisms control information flow
Maintain gradients over long sequences

Selective Memory:
Learn what to remember and forget
More sophisticated than simple hidden state

Cell State:
Separate memory cell from hidden state
Long-term memory storage

Gating Units:
Control information flow through network
Learn when to update, forget, or output

3.2 LSTM Architecture:
---------------------
Cell State:
Cₜ ∈ ℝʰ: long-term memory
Flows through network with minimal interference

Hidden State:
hₜ ∈ ℝʰ: short-term memory/output
Filtered version of cell state

Three Gates:
1. Forget Gate: What to remove from cell state
2. Input Gate: What new information to store
3. Output Gate: What parts of cell state to output

3.3 LSTM Equations:
------------------
Forget Gate:
fₜ = σ(Wf · [hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bf)

Input Gate:
iₜ = σ(Wi · [hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bi)

Candidate Values:
C̃ₜ = tanh(WC · [hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bC)

Cell State Update:
Cₜ = fₜ * Cₜ₋₁ + iₜ * C̃ₜ

Output Gate:
oₜ = σ(Wo · [hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bo)

Hidden State Update:
hₜ = oₜ * tanh(Cₜ)

where * denotes element-wise multiplication

3.4 LSTM Gate Functions:
-----------------------
Forget Gate:
- Decides what information to discard
- σ(·) ∈ (0, 1): 0 = forget, 1 = keep
- Looks at hₜ₋₁ and xₜ

Input Gate:
- Decides what new information to store
- Two parts: what to update (iₜ) and new candidate values (C̃ₜ)
- Selective updating of cell state

Output Gate:
- Decides what parts of cell state to output
- Controls how much cell state influences hidden state
- Filtered output based on current input and previous hidden state

Cell State Flow:
- Highway for information flow
- Minimal interference (just + and *)
- Enables gradient flow over long sequences

3.5 LSTM Variants:
-----------------
Vanilla LSTM:
Standard architecture described above
Most commonly used variant

Peephole Connections:
Gates can look at cell state:
fₜ = σ(Wf · [Cₜ₋₁, hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bf)

Coupled Forget/Input Gates:
fₜ = σ(Wf · [hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bf)
iₜ = 1 - fₜ

Forget gate and input gate sum to 1
Reduces parameters and can improve performance

4.2 GRU Architecture:
--------------------
Reset Gate:

Update Gate:
zₜ = σ(Wz · [hₜ₋₁, xₜ])

Candidate Hidden State:
h̃ₜ = tanh(W · [rₜ * hₜ₋₁, xₜ])

Hidden State Update:
hₜ = (1 - zₜ) * hₜ₋₁ + zₜ * h̃ₜ

4.3 GRU Gate Functions:
----------------------

- 0 = ignore previous state, 1 = use fully
- Allows network to drop irrelevant information

Can make better predictions with complete context

5.2 Bidirectional Architecture:
------------------------------

h⃖ₜ = f(W⃖xₜ + U⃖h⃖ₜ₊₁ + b⃖)

Output Combination:
hₜ = [h⃗ₜ; h⃖ₜ] (concatenation)
or hₜ = h⃗ₜ + h⃖ₜ (sum)
or hₜ = σ(W[h⃗ₜ; h⃖ₜ] + b) (learned combination)

Cannot process streaming data
Requires complete sequence before processing

Latency:
Must wait for entire sequence
Not suitable for real-time applications
