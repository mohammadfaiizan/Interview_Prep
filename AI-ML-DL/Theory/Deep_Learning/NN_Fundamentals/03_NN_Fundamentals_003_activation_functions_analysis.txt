1. ACTIVATION FUNCTION FUNDAMENTALS
==================================

1.1 Role of Activation Functions:
--------------------------------
Non-linearity Introduction:
Without activation functions, neural networks are linear models
f(Wx + b) = linear transformation regardless of depth

Mathematical Necessity:
For network f(x) = f^(L)(f^(L-1)(...f^(1)(x)...))
If all f^(i) are linear: f(x) = Ax + b (single linear transformation)

Expressiveness:
Non-linear activations enable:
- Complex decision boundaries
- Universal approximation capabilities
- Hierarchical feature learning

1.2 Activation Function Requirements:
------------------------------------
Essential Properties:
1. Non-linearity (except for specific cases)
2. Differentiability (for gradient-based optimization)
3. Monotonicity (often preferred for optimization)
4. Bounded or unbounded range (task-dependent)
5. Computational efficiency

Gradient Flow:
Derivative should not vanish everywhere
Enable error propagation through network layers

Saturation Behavior:
Some functions saturate (derivative → 0)
Can cause vanishing gradient problems

1.3 Mathematical Framework:
--------------------------
Activation Function: σ: ℝ → ℝ
Applied element-wise to pre-activation values

Layer Computation:
z^(l) = W^(l)h^(l-1) + b^(l)
h^(l) = σ(z^(l))

Gradient Computation:
∂h^(l)/∂z^(l) = σ'(z^(l))
Required for backpropagation

1.4 Biological Inspiration:
--------------------------
Neuron Model:
Biological neurons have activation thresholds
Fire when stimulus exceeds threshold

Step Function:
Heaviside step function models neuron firing
σ(z) = {1 if z ≥ 0, 0 if z < 0}

Limitations:
- Non-differentiable
- Binary output
- No gradient information

Smooth Approximations:
Sigmoid and tanh approximate step function
Differentiable alternatives

1.5 Historical Evolution:
------------------------
