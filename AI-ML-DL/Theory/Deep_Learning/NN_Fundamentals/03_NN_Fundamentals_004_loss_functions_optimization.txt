=======================================================

1. LOSS FUNCTION FUNDAMENTALS
=============================

1.1 Role of Loss Functions:
--------------------------
Learning Objective:
Loss function defines what the model should optimize
Measures discrepancy between predictions and ground truth

Mathematical Framework:
L(θ) = ∑ᵢ ℓ(f(xᵢ; θ), yᵢ) + R(θ)

where:
- ℓ: per-example loss function
- f(xᵢ; θ): model prediction for input xᵢ
- yᵢ: ground truth label
- R(θ): regularization term

Gradient Computation:
∇_θ L(θ) guides parameter updates
Loss function must be differentiable

1.2 Loss Function Properties:
----------------------------
Essential Characteristics:
1. Differentiability (for gradient-based optimization)
2. Convexity (preferred but not required)
3. Robustness to outliers (task-dependent)
4. Computational efficiency
5. Task-appropriate behavior

Convexity:
Convex loss functions have global minimum
Non-convex losses may have local minima

Lipschitz Continuity:
Bounded gradient ensures stable optimization
|∇L(θ₁) - ∇L(θ₂)| ≤ K||θ₁ - θ₂||

1.3 Types of Loss Functions:
---------------------------
By Task Type:
- Regression: Continuous target prediction
- Classification: Discrete class prediction
- Ranking: Relative ordering
- Density estimation: Probability modeling

By Robustness:
- L₂ losses: Sensitive to outliers
- L₁ losses: Robust to outliers
- Huber losses: Compromise between L₁ and L₂

By Complexity:
- Simple: Direct comparison with ground truth
- Complex: Involve adversarial terms, multiple components

1.4 Maximum Likelihood Connection:
---------------------------------
Probabilistic Interpretation:
Many loss functions derived from maximum likelihood estimation

General Form:
L(θ) = -∑ᵢ log p(yᵢ|xᵢ; θ)

where p(yᵢ|xᵢ; θ) is predicted probability of yᵢ given xᵢ

Examples:

- Categorical likelihood → Cross-entropy loss
- Laplace likelihood → MAE loss

1.5 Loss Function Selection:
---------------------------

    def focal_loss_fixed(y_true, y_pred):
        epsilon = tf.keras.backend.epsilon()
        y_pred = tf.clip_by_value(y_pred, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)
        p_t = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1), y_pred, 1 - y_pred)
        alpha_factor = tf.ones_like(y_true) * alpha
        alpha_t = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1), alpha_factor, 1 - alpha_factor)
        cross_entropy = -tf.log(p_t)
        weight = alpha_t * tf.pow((1 - p_t), gamma)
