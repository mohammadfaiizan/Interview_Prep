1. BACKPROPAGATION FUNDAMENTALS
===============================

1.1 Algorithm Overview:
----------------------
Backpropagation (Error Backpropagation):
Efficient algorithm for computing gradients of loss function
with respect to neural network parameters

Key Innovation:
Computes all gradients in O(forward pass time)
Without backprop: O(parameters × forward pass time)

Historical Context:
- Developed independently multiple times
- Werbos (1974), Parker (1985), Rumelhart et al. (1986)
- Revolutionized neural network training

Two Phases:
1. Forward Pass: Compute network output and loss
2. Backward Pass: Compute gradients via chain rule

1.2 Mathematical Foundation:
---------------------------
Objective Function:
Minimize loss L(θ) = ∑ᵢ ℓ(f(xᵢ; θ), yᵢ) + R(θ)

where:
- θ: all network parameters (weights and biases)
- f(xᵢ; θ): network output for input xᵢ
- ℓ: per-example loss function
- R(θ): regularization term

Gradient Requirement:
Need ∇_θ L(θ) for gradient-based optimization

Challenge:
θ can contain millions or billions of parameters
Direct computation infeasible

Solution:
Chain rule enables efficient gradient computation
through computational graph structure

1.3 Chain Rule Foundation:
-------------------------
Composite Function Differentiation:
For f(g(x)): df/dx = (df/dg) × (dg/dx)

Multivariate Extension:
For f(g₁(x), g₂(x), ..., gₙ(x)):
∂f/∂x = ∑ᵢ (∂f/∂gᵢ) × (∂gᵢ/∂x)

Neural Network Application:
Network is composition of layer functions
f(x) = f^(L)(f^(L-1)(...f^(1)(x)...))

Gradient flows backward through layers:
∂L/∂θ^(l) = (∂L/∂h^(l)) × (∂h^(l)/∂θ^(l))

1.4 Computational Efficiency:
----------------------------
Forward Mode vs Reverse Mode:
- Forward mode: Propagate derivatives forward
- Reverse mode: Propagate derivatives backward
- Backprop uses reverse mode

Time Complexity Comparison:
- Forward mode: O(inputs × outputs) per gradient
- Reverse mode: O(1) per gradient
- For neural networks: reverse mode much more efficient

Memory Trade-off:
Backward pass requires storing forward pass activations
Memory complexity: O(network depth × batch size)

1.5 Algorithmic Framework:
-------------------------
High-Level Algorithm:
```
For each training example (x, y):
    1. Forward pass: compute loss L
    2. Backward pass: compute gradients ∇L
    3. Update parameters: θ ← θ - η∇L
```

Detailed Steps:
1. Initialize parameters θ
2. While not converged:
   a. Sample mini-batch (X, Y)
   b. Forward pass: compute predictions and loss
   c. Backward pass: compute parameter gradients
   d. Update parameters using optimization algorithm
   e. Evaluate on validation set

=======================================================

2. FORWARD PASS COMPUTATION
===========================

2.1 Layer-by-Layer Computation:
------------------------------
Sequential Processing:
Information flows forward through network layers
Each layer transforms input using learned parameters

Mathematical Formulation:
For layer l:
z^(l) = W^(l) h^(l-1) + b^(l)  (linear transformation)
h^(l) = f^(l)(z^(l))           (activation function)

where:
- h^(l-1): input from previous layer
- W^(l): weight matrix for layer l
- b^(l): bias vector for layer l
- f^(l): activation function for layer l
- z^(l): pre-activation values
- h^(l): post-activation values (layer output)

Initial Condition:
h^(0) = x (network input)

Final Output:
ŷ = h^(L) (network prediction)

2.2 Activation Functions:
------------------------
Common Activation Functions:

Sigmoid: σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))
Derivative: σ'(z) = σ(z)(1 - σ(z))

Tanh: tanh(z) = (e^z - e^(-z))/(e^z + e^(-z))
Derivative: tanh'(z) = 1 - tanh²(z)

ReLU: ReLU(z) = max(0, z)
Derivative: ReLU'(z) = {1 if z > 0, 0 if z < 0, undefined if z = 0}

Leaky ReLU: LReLU(z) = max(αz, z) where α ∈ (0, 1)
Derivative: LReLU'(z) = {1 if z > 0, α if z < 0}

2.3 Loss Function Computation:
-----------------------------
Per-Example Loss:
ℓᵢ = ℓ(ŷᵢ, yᵢ)

Common Loss Functions:

Mean Squared Error:
ℓ(ŷ, y) = ½||ŷ - y||²
∂ℓ/∂ŷ = ŷ - y

Cross-Entropy (Binary):
ℓ(ŷ, y) = -y log(ŷ) - (1-y) log(1-ŷ)
∂ℓ/∂ŷ = (ŷ - y)/(ŷ(1-ŷ))

Cross-Entropy (Multi-class):
ℓ(ŷ, y) = -∑ⱼ yⱼ log(ŷⱼ)
∂ℓ/∂ŷⱼ = -yⱼ/ŷⱼ

Batch Loss:
L = (1/m) ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵐ ℓᵢ + λR(θ)

where m is batch size and R(θ) is regularization

2.4 Forward Pass Implementation:
-------------------------------
Matrix Operations:
Vectorized computation for efficiency
Batch processing multiple examples simultaneously

Pseudocode:
```python
def forward_pass(X, weights, biases, activations):
    h = X  # Initial input
    cache = [h]  # Store for backward pass
    
    for l in range(num_layers):
        z = np.dot(h, weights[l]) + biases[l]
        h = activations[l](z)
        cache.append((z, h))
    
    return h, cache
```

Caching Strategy:
Store intermediate values needed for backward pass
Trade memory for computational efficiency

2.5 Numerical Considerations:
----------------------------
Numerical Stability:
- Avoid overflow/underflow in exponential functions
- Use stable implementations (e.g., log-sum-exp trick)
- Monitor gradient magnitudes

Precision Issues:
- Floating-point arithmetic limitations
- Accumulation of rounding errors
- Consider mixed-precision training

Batch Processing:
- Process multiple examples simultaneously
- Better GPU utilization
- More stable gradient estimates

=======================================================

3. BACKWARD PASS AND GRADIENT FLOW
==================================

3.1 Gradient Flow Overview:
--------------------------
Reverse Mode Differentiation:
Start from loss function
Propagate gradients backward through network

Key Insight:
∂L/∂θ^(l) = (∂L/∂h^(l)) × (∂h^(l)/∂θ^(l))

Gradient signals flow from output to input
Each layer computes local gradients and passes upstream gradients

3.2 Output Layer Gradients:
---------------------------
Loss Gradient:
∂L/∂ŷ computed directly from loss function

For mean squared error:
∂L/∂ŷ = ŷ - y

For cross-entropy with softmax:
∂L/∂z^(L) = ŷ - y (simplified form)

This becomes starting point for backward pass

3.3 Hidden Layer Gradients:
---------------------------
Activation Gradients:
∂L/∂h^(l) received from layer l+1

Pre-activation Gradients:
∂L/∂z^(l) = (∂L/∂h^(l)) ⊙ f'^(l)(z^(l))

where ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication

Weight Gradients:
∂L/∂W^(l) = h^(l-1) ⊗ (∂L/∂z^(l))

where ⊗ denotes outer product

Bias Gradients:
∂L/∂b^(l) = ∂L/∂z^(l)

Upstream Gradients:
∂L/∂h^(l-1) = W^(l)ᵀ (∂L/∂z^(l))

3.4 Gradient Computation Algorithm:
----------------------------------
Backward Pass Pseudocode:
```python
def backward_pass(cache, loss_grad):
    grads = {}
    dh = loss_grad  # Gradient w.r.t. output
    
    for l in reversed(range(num_layers)):
        z, h_prev = cache[l], cache[l-1]
        
        # Gradient w.r.t. pre-activation
        dz = dh * activation_derivative(z)
        
        # Gradients w.r.t. parameters
        grads[f'W{l}'] = np.dot(h_prev.T, dz)
        grads[f'b{l}'] = np.sum(dz, axis=0)
        
        # Gradient w.r.t. previous layer
        if l > 0:
            dh = np.dot(dz, weights[l].T)
    
    return grads
```

3.5 Matrix Calculus Details:
----------------------------
Jacobian Matrices:
For vector-valued functions f: ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ
J[f]ᵢⱼ = ∂fᵢ/∂xⱼ

Chain Rule for Vectors:
∂L/∂x = Jᵀ[f] (∂L/∂f)

where J[f] is Jacobian of f with respect to x

Dimension Tracking:
- Input h^(l-1): (batch_size, input_dim)
- Weights W^(l): (input_dim, output_dim)
- Output h^(l): (batch_size, output_dim)
- Weight gradients: same shape as weights

3.6 Activation Function Derivatives:
-----------------------------------
Sigmoid Derivative:
σ'(z) = σ(z)(1 - σ(z))
Can reuse forward pass computation

Tanh Derivative:
tanh'(z) = 1 - tanh²(z)
Also reusable from forward pass

ReLU Derivative:
ReLU'(z) = {1 if z > 0, 0 otherwise}
Simple thresholding operation

Softmax Derivative:
For softmax S(z)ᵢ = e^(zᵢ)/∑ⱼe^(zⱼ):
∂Sᵢ/∂zⱼ = Sᵢ(δᵢⱼ - Sⱼ)

Combined with cross-entropy:
∂L/∂z = ŷ - y (elegant simplification)

=======================================================

4. CHAIN RULE AND CALCULUS
==========================

4.1 Univariate Chain Rule:
--------------------------
Basic Form:
If y = f(u) and u = g(x), then:
dy/dx = (dy/du) × (du/dx)

Neural Network Application:
Loss L depends on output ŷ
Output ŷ depends on weights W
Therefore: ∂L/∂W = (∂L/∂ŷ) × (∂ŷ/∂W)

Extended Chain:
For deeper dependencies:
∂L/∂W^(1) = (∂L/∂ŷ) × (∂ŷ/∂h^(L-1)) × ... × (∂h^(2)/∂h^(1)) × (∂h^(1)/∂W^(1))

4.2 Multivariate Chain Rule:
----------------------------
General Form:
For z = f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) where each xᵢ = gᵢ(t):
dz/dt = ∑ᵢ (∂z/∂xᵢ) × (dxᵢ/dt)

Vector Form:
For f: ℝⁿ → ℝ and g: ℝᵐ → ℝⁿ:
∇ₓ(f ∘ g) = Jᵀ[g] ∇(f ∘ g)

Neural Network Layers:
Each layer is vector-valued function
Jacobians combine via matrix multiplication

4.3 Computational Graph Perspective:

4.5 Higher-Order Derivatives:

- Usually too expensive for deep networks

4.6 Gradient Verification:
-------------------------
Numerical Gradient Checking:
Compare analytical gradients with numerical approximation

Finite Difference:
∂f/∂x ≈ (f(x + ε) - f(x - ε))/(2ε)

Implementation:
```python
def gradient_check(f, x, analytical_grad, eps=1e-7):
    numerical_grad = np.zeros_like(x)
    for i in range(x.size):
        x_plus = x.copy()
        x_minus = x.copy()
        x_plus[i] += eps
        x_minus[i] -= eps
        
        numerical_grad[i] = (f(x_plus) - f(x_minus)) / (2 * eps)
    
    relative_error = np.abs(analytical_grad - numerical_grad) / \
                    np.maximum(np.abs(analytical_grad), np.abs(numerical_grad))
    
    return relative_error
```
