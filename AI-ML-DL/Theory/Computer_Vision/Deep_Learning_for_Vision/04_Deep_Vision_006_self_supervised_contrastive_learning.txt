1. INTRODUCTION TO SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING
================================================================================

1.1 Definition and Motivation
-----------------------------
Self-supervised learning (SSL) aims to learn meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data by creating supervisory signals from the data itself, without requiring human annotations.

**Key Principles:**
- Generate labels automatically from data structure
- Learn representations that capture semantic information
- Reduce dependence on expensive manual labeling
- Enable learning from large-scale unlabeled datasets

**Pretext Tasks:** Artificial tasks designed to learn useful representations:
- Predicting image rotations
- Solving jigsaw puzzles
- Inpainting masked regions
- Predicting relative positions
- Colorizing grayscale images

1.2 Mathematical Framework
--------------------------
**General SSL Objective:**
θ* = argmin_θ L_pretext(f_θ(x), t(x))

Where:
- f_θ: Neural network with parameters θ
- x: Input data
- t(x): Automatically generated target/label
- L_pretext: Pretext task loss function

**Representation Quality:**
Good representations should satisfy:
- **Invariance:** Similar representations for semantically similar inputs
- **Equivariance:** Predictable changes for specific transformations
- **Discriminability:** Different representations for different semantic content

1.3 Categories of Self-Supervised Learning
------------------------------------------
**Predictive Methods:**
- Predict future frames in video
- Predict missing parts of images
- Predict transformations applied to data

**Contrastive Methods:**
- Maximize agreement between augmented views
- Minimize agreement between different samples
- Learn by comparing positive and negative pairs

**Generative Methods:**
- Autoencoders and variational autoencoders
- Generative adversarial networks
- Masked language/image modeling

**Clustering-based Methods:**
- Online clustering of representations
- Prototypical networks
- Deep clustering approaches

================================================================================
2. CONTRASTIVE LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

2.1 Core Concepts
-----------------
Contrastive learning learns representations by contrasting positive pairs (similar samples) against negative pairs (dissimilar samples).

**InfoNCE Loss (Noise Contrastive Estimation):**
L_InfoNCE = -log(exp(sim(z_i, z_j)/τ) / Σ_k exp(sim(z_i, z_k)/τ))

Where:
- z_i, z_j: Representations of positive pair
- z_k: Representations of negative samples
- sim(·,·): Similarity function (typically cosine similarity)
- τ: Temperature parameter

**Key Components:**
- **Data Augmentation:** Creating positive pairs through transformations
- **Encoder Network:** Maps inputs to representation space
- **Similarity Metric:** Measures distance between representations
- **Negative Sampling:** Strategy for selecting negative examples

2.2 Similarity Functions
-----------------------
**Cosine Similarity:**
sim(u,v) = (u·v)/(||u|| ||v||)

**Euclidean Distance:**
d(u,v) = ||u - v||₂

**Bilinear Similarity:**
sim(u,v) = u^T W v

**Dot Product:**
sim(u,v) = u·v

2.3 Temperature Parameter τ
---------------------------
Controls the concentration of the distribution:
- **Low τ:** Sharp distribution, focuses on hardest negatives
- **High τ:** Smooth distribution, considers all negatives equally
- **Typical values:** τ ∈ [0.05, 0.5]

**Effect on Gradient:**
∂L/∂z_i ∝ (1/τ) Σ_k [p_k - δ_k] ∇sim(z_i, z_k)

Where p_k is the softmax probability and δ_k indicates positive pairs.

================================================================================
3. SIMCLR: SIMPLE FRAMEWORK FOR CONTRASTIVE LEARNING
================================================================================

3.1 SimCLR Architecture
----------------------
SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) consists of four key components:

**1. Data Augmentation Module:**
Generates pairs of augmented views from original images:
- Random cropping and resizing
- Color distortion (brightness, contrast, saturation, hue)
- Gaussian blur
- Random grayscale conversion

**2. Base Encoder f(·):**
- Typically ResNet architecture
- Extracts representation vectors from augmented data
- h_i = f(x̃_i) where x̃_i is augmented image

**3. Projection Head g(·):**
- Small MLP that maps representations to contrastive learning space
- z_i = g(h_i) = W^(2)σ(W^(1)h_i)
- Usually 2-layer MLP with ReLU activation

**4. Contrastive Loss:**
- NT-Xent (Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross-Entropy Loss)
- Applied to projection head outputs z_i

3.2 NT-Xent Loss
---------------
**For a batch of N samples (2N augmented views):**
L_i,j = -log(exp(sim(z_i, z_j)/τ) / Σ_{k=1}^{2N} 𝟙[k≠i] exp(sim(z_i, z_k)/τ))

**Total Loss:**
L = (1/2N) Σ_{k=1}^{N} [L_{2k-1,2k} + L_{2k,2k-1}]

Where (2k-1, 2k) form a positive pair.

3.3 Training Algorithm
---------------------
```
Algorithm: SimCLR Training
Input: Unlabeled dataset D, batch size N, temperature τ
Output: Trained encoder f and projection head g

for epoch in epochs:
    Sample minibatch {x_k}_{k=1}^N from D
    
    for k = 1 to N:
        Generate two augmented views: x̃_{2k-1}, x̃_{2k} ~ t(x_k)
    
    for i = 1 to 2N:
        h_i = f(x̃_i)          # Extract representation
        z_i = g(h_i)          # Apply projection head
        z_i = z_i / ||z_i||   # L2 normalize
    
    Compute NT-Xent loss L over all pairs
    Update parameters θ_f, θ_g using gradients ∇L
```

3.4 Key Design Choices
---------------------
**Large Batch Sizes:**
- More negative samples improve representation quality
- Typical batch sizes: 256-8192
- Distributed training across multiple GPUs

**Strong Data Augmentation:**
- Combination of augmentations more effective than individual ones
- Color distortion particularly important
- Random cropping provides spatial invariance

**Projection Head Benefits:**
- Improves representation quality compared to using h directly
- Can be discarded after training (use h for downstream tasks)
- Prevents dimensional collapse

**Temperature Scaling:**
- Lower temperature improves performance
- Typical range: τ ∈ [0.1, 0.5]
- Requires careful tuning with batch size

================================================================================
4. MOCO: MOMENTUM CONTRAST FOR VISUAL REPRESENTATION LEARNING
================================================================================

4.1 MoCo Motivation and Approach
-------------------------------
**Problem with SimCLR:** Requires very large batch sizes for sufficient negative samples, leading to computational challenges.

**MoCo Solution:** Maintain a dynamic dictionary of encoded keys as a queue, enabling large and consistent dictionary size.

**Key Innovations:**
- **Queue-based Dictionary:** Stores encoded representations
- **Momentum Update:** Slowly updates key encoder
- **Dynamic Dictionary:** Maintains consistent negative samples

4.2 MoCo Architecture
--------------------
**Components:**
1. **Query Encoder f_q:** Encodes query samples (updated by backprop)
2. **Key Encoder f_k:** Encodes key samples (updated by momentum)
3. **Queue:** Stores encoded keys from previous mini-batches
4. **Momentum Update:** f_k ← m·f_k + (1-m)·f_q

**Dictionary Lookup:**
- Query q = f_q(x^query)
- Positive key k₊ = f_k(x^key) where x^key is augmented version of x^query
- Negative keys {k₋} from queue

4.3 Momentum Update Mechanism
----------------------------
**Update Rule:**
θ_k ← m·θ_k + (1-m)·θ_q

Where:
- θ_k: Parameters of key encoder
- θ_q: Parameters of query encoder  
- m: Momentum coefficient (typically 0.999)

**Benefits:**
- Slowly evolving key encoder provides consistent features
- Prevents rapid changes that would make queue inconsistent
- Enables large effective batch size without memory constraints

4.4 Training Procedure
---------------------
```
Algorithm: MoCo Training
Input: Dataset D, queue size K, momentum m
Initialize: f_q, f_k (f_k initialized from f_q), empty queue Q

for each mini-batch:
    # Forward pass
    q = f_q(x^query)                    # Query encoding
    k = f_k(x^key)                      # Key encoding
    
    # Contrastive loss
    l_pos = -log(exp(q·k₊/τ))          # Positive pair
    l_neg = log(Σ exp(q·kᵢ/τ))         # Negative pairs from queue
    loss = l_pos + l_neg
    
    # Update query encoder
    f_q ← f_q - lr·∇loss
    
    # Momentum update for key encoder
    f_k ← m·f_k + (1-m)·f_q
    
    # Update queue
    Q.enqueue(k)                        # Add current keys
    if len(Q) > K:
        Q.dequeue()                     # Remove oldest keys
```

4.5 MoCo v2 and v3 Improvements

================================================================================
5. BYOL: BOOTSTRAP YOUR OWN LATENT
================================================================================

5.1 BYOL Overview
----------------
BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent) learns representations without negative samples by using two neural networks (online and target) that learn from each other.

**Key Innovation:** Avoids collapse without negative samples through:
- Asymmetric architecture
- Exponential moving average (EMA) updates
- Prediction head on online network only

5.2 BYOL Architecture
--------------------
**Online Network:** θ
- Encoder: f_θ
- Projector: g_θ  
- Predictor: q_θ

**Target Network:** ξ
- Encoder: f_ξ
- Projector: g_ξ
- No predictor

**Forward Pass:**
```
# Online network
y = f_θ(augment(x))      # Online representation
z = g_θ(y)              # Online projection  
p = q_θ(z)              # Online prediction

# Target network  
y' = f_ξ(augment(x))     # Target representation
z' = g_ξ(y')            # Target projection (stop gradient)
```

5.3 BYOL Loss Function
---------------------
**Regression Loss:**
L_θ,ξ = ||p - sg(z')||²₂

Where:
- p: Prediction from online network
- z': Projection from target network  
- sg(·): Stop gradient operation

**Symmetric Loss:**
L = L_θ,ξ(x) + L_θ,ξ(x')

Where x and x' are different augmented views.

5.4 Target Network Update
-------------------------
**Exponential Moving Average:**
ξ ← τ·ξ + (1-τ)·θ

Where:
- τ: Target decay rate (typically 0.99-0.999)
- θ: Online network parameters
- ξ: Target network parameters

**Schedule for τ:**
τ = τ_base + (1 - τ_base) · (cos(π·k/K) + 1)/2

Where k is current step and K is total training steps.

5.5 Why BYOL Works Without Negatives
------------------------------------
**Theoretical Analysis:**
1. **Asymmetry:** Different processing paths prevent trivial solutions
2. **Moving Average:** Provides stable targets for learning
3. **Prediction Head:** Forces online network to adapt and predict
4. **Data Augmentation:** Provides sufficient variation in inputs

**Empirical Observations:**
- Target network acts as a momentum teacher
- Prediction head prevents representation collapse
- Strong augmentation crucial for avoiding trivial solutions

================================================================================
6. SWAV AND CLUSTERING-BASED METHODS
================================================================================

6.1 SwAV: Swapping Assignments between Views
--------------------------------------------
SwAV combines contrastive learning with online clustering to learn representations without requiring pairwise comparisons.

**Key Ideas:**
- Cluster image features online
- Predict cluster assignment of one view from another
- "Swapped" prediction: predict assignment of augmented view

6.2 SwAV Algorithm
-----------------
**Cluster Assignment:**
For representation z, compute soft assignment:
q = softmax(z^T C / τ)

Where C contains cluster prototypes.

**Swapped Prediction Loss:**
L(z_t, z_s) = -Σ_k q_t^(k) log p_s^(k)

Where:
- q_t: Target assignment (computed from z_t)
- p_s: Predicted assignment (from z_s through network)

**Complete Algorithm:**
```
1. Compute features z_t, z_s from different augmented views
2. Update prototypes C using online k-means
3. Compute cluster assignments q_t = softmax(z_t^T C / τ)
4. Predict assignments p_s from z_s
5. Minimize cross-entropy loss between q_t and p_s
```

6.3 Online Clustering
---------------------
**Prototype Update:**
C ← C + η·(Z^T Q - |B|·C)

Where:
- Z: Batch of features
- Q: Batch of assignments
- |B|: Batch size
- η: Learning rate for prototypes

**Preventing Trivial Solutions:**
- **Equipartition Constraint:** Equal assignment probabilities
- **Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm:** Enforces balanced assignments
- **Multi-crop Strategy:** Different crop sizes for scale invariance

================================================================================
7. DINO AND SELF-DISTILLATION APPROACHES
================================================================================

------------------------------------------
DINO (Self-Distillation with No Labels) applies knowledge distillation in self-supervised setting using Vision Transformers.

**Architecture:**
- **Student Network:** Updated by gradient descent
- **Teacher Network:** Updated by exponential moving average
- **Identical Architecture:** Both networks have same structure

7.2 DINO Training Framework
--------------------------
**Loss Function:**
L = -Σ_x P_t(x) log P_s(x)

Where:
- P_t: Teacher softmax output (with temperature τ_t)
- P_s: Student softmax output (with temperature τ_s)
- Typically τ_t < τ_s for sharpened teacher predictions

**Multi-crop Strategy:**
- Generate crops of different sizes
- Small crops (96×96) and large crops (224×224)
- Teacher sees only large crops
- Student sees all crops

**Centering and Sharpening:**
```
# Teacher output
P_t = softmax((f_t(x) - c) / τ_t)

# Student output  
P_s = softmax(f_s(x) / τ_s)

# Update center
c ← m·c + (1-m)·mean(f_t(batch))
```

```

**Masking Strategy:**
- Random masking of 75% patches
- High masking ratio forces semantic understanding
- Reconstruction in pixel space

**Loss Function:**
L_MAE = ||x_mask - x̂_mask||²₂

Where x_mask are masked patches and x̂_mask are reconstructions.

```

Where s_ij is similarity between image i and text j.
