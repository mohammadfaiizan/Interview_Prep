1. INTRODUCTION TO GENERATIVE MODELS IN COMPUTER VISION
================================================================================

1.1 Definition and Overview
---------------------------
Generative models in computer vision learn to create new images by modeling the underlying data distribution P(x) where x represents image data. Unlike discriminative models that learn P(y|x), generative models can:

- Generate new samples from learned distributions
- Perform image editing and manipulation
- Enable style transfer and domain adaptation
- Provide data augmentation capabilities

**Key Types of Generative Models:**
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Autoregressive Models
- Flow-based Models
- Diffusion Models

1.2 Mathematical Foundations
----------------------------
**Probability Distribution Learning:**
Given training data {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ} ~ P_data(x), learn model P_θ(x) ≈ P_data(x)

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation:**
θ* = argmax_θ ∏ᵢ P_θ(xᵢ) = argmax_θ ∑ᵢ log P_θ(xᵢ)

**KL Divergence:**
D_KL(P_data||P_θ) = ∫ P_data(x) log(P_data(x)/P_θ(x)) dx

1.3 Applications in Computer Vision
-----------------------------------
- **Data Augmentation:** Generating synthetic training data
- **Image Completion:** Inpainting missing regions
- **Super-resolution:** Enhancing image resolution
- **Style Transfer:** Changing artistic style while preserving content
- **Domain Adaptation:** Translating between different visual domains

================================================================================
2. NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

2.1 Concept and Motivation
--------------------------
Neural Style Transfer (NST) aims to combine the content of one image with the style of another, creating a new image that preserves the content structure while adopting the artistic style.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
Given content image C and style image S, find image X that minimizes:
L_total = α·L_content(C, X) + β·L_style(S, X)

Where:
- α, β are weighting parameters
- L_content measures content preservation
- L_style measures style similarity

2.2 Content Representation
--------------------------
Content is represented using feature maps from convolutional layers of a pre-trained CNN (typically VGG-19).

**Content Loss:**
L_content(C, X) = (1/2) ∑ᵢⱼ (F_ij^l - P_ij^l)²

Where:
- F^l: Feature map of content image at layer l
- P^l: Feature map of generated image at layer l
- i, j: Spatial positions in feature map

**Layer Selection:**
- Lower layers: Capture fine details, textures
- Higher layers: Capture semantic content, object shapes
- Typically use conv4_2 or conv5_2 for content

2.3 Style Representation
-----------------------
Style is captured using Gram matrices that measure correlations between different feature channels.

**Gram Matrix:**
G_ij^l = ∑_k F_ik^l F_jk^l

Where:
- F^l: Feature map at layer l
- i, j: Channel indices
- k: Spatial position index

**Style Loss:**
L_style(S, X) = ∑_l w_l E_l

Where:
E_l = (1/(4N_l²M_l²)) ∑ᵢⱼ (G_ij^l - A_ij^l)²

- G^l: Gram matrix of style image
- A^l: Gram matrix of generated image  
- N_l: Number of channels at layer l
- M_l: Size of feature map at layer l
- w_l: Layer weight

2.4 Optimization Process
-----------------------
**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize X (typically with content image or noise)
2. Forward pass through pre-trained CNN
3. Compute content and style losses
4. Backpropagate to update pixel values of X
5. Repeat until convergence

**Optimization Equation:**
X_{t+1} = X_t - η·∇_X L_total

**Challenges:**
- Slow optimization (requires many iterations)
- Memory intensive for high-resolution images
- Sensitive to hyperparameter selection

================================================================================
3. GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS FOR IMAGES
================================================================================

3.1 GAN Architecture and Training
---------------------------------
GANs consist of two neural networks competing in a minimax game:

**Generator G:** Maps noise z to fake images G(z)
**Discriminator D:** Distinguishes real from fake images

**Objective Function:**
min_G max_D V(D,G) = E_x~p_data[log D(x)] + E_z~p_z[log(1-D(G(z)))]

**Training Algorithm:**
```
for epoch in epochs:
    # Train Discriminator
    for k steps:
        Sample minibatch of m noise samples {z⁽¹⁾, ..., z⁽ᵐ⁾}
        Sample minibatch of m examples {x⁽¹⁾, ..., x⁽ᵐ⁾}
        Update discriminator by ascending stochastic gradient:
        ∇_θd (1/m) ∑ᵢ[log D(x⁽ⁱ⁾) + log(1-D(G(z⁽ⁱ⁾)))]
    
    # Train Generator
    Sample minibatch of m noise samples {z⁽¹⁾, ..., z⁽ᵐ⁾}
    Update generator by descending stochastic gradient:
    ∇_θg (1/m) ∑ᵢ log(1-D(G(z⁽ⁱ⁾)))
```

3.2 DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
----------------------------------
Key architectural guidelines for stable training:

**Generator Architecture:**
- Replace pooling with fractional-strided convolutions
- Use batch normalization in both generator and discriminator
- Remove fully connected hidden layers
- Use ReLU activation in generator except for output (Tanh)
- Use LeakyReLU activation in discriminator

**Discriminator Architecture:**
- Use strided convolutions instead of pooling
- Use batch normalization (except discriminator input layer)
- Use LeakyReLU activations

**Network Design Pattern:**
```
Generator: Z → FC → Reshape → ConvTranspose → BN → ReLU → ... → ConvTranspose → Tanh
Discriminator: Image → Conv → LeakyReLU → BN → ... → Conv → Sigmoid
```

3.3 Training Challenges and Solutions
------------------------------------
**Mode Collapse:** Generator produces limited variety
- Solution: Unrolled GANs, Mini-batch discrimination

**Training Instability:** Oscillations, non-convergence
- Solution: Feature matching, historical averaging

**Vanishing Gradients:** Discriminator becomes too strong
- Solution: Wasserstein GAN, Spectral normalization

**Evaluation Difficulties:** No clear objective metric
- Solutions: Inception Score (IS), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)

================================================================================
4. IMAGE-TO-IMAGE TRANSLATION
================================================================================

4.1 Problem Formulation
-----------------------
Image-to-image translation learns mapping between different visual domains:
G: X → Y, where X and Y are different image domains

**Examples:**
- Semantic labels → Realistic images
- Day → Night scenes
- Sketches → Photographs
- Satellite → Map images
- Black & White → Colorized images

**Mathematical Framework:**
Learn conditional distribution P(y|x) where x ∈ X, y ∈ Y

4.2 Paired vs Unpaired Translation
----------------------------------
**Paired Translation:**
- Training data: {(xᵢ, yᵢ)} where yᵢ is ground truth for xᵢ
- Direct supervision available
- Examples: Pix2Pix, BicycleGAN

**Unpaired Translation:**
- Training data: {xᵢ} and {yⱼ} from different domains
- No direct correspondence between images
- Examples: CycleGAN, UNIT, MUNIT

4.3 Conditional Generation Framework
-----------------------------------
**Conditional GAN Objective:**
L_cGAN(G,D) = E_x,y[log D(x,y)] + E_x,z[log(1-D(x,G(x,z)))]

Where:
- x: Input image
- y: Target image
- z: Random noise (for stochasticity)
- G: Generator network
- D: Discriminator network

================================================================================
5. PIX2PIX AND CONDITIONAL GANS
================================================================================

5.1 Pix2Pix Architecture
------------------------
Pix2Pix combines cGAN loss with L1 reconstruction loss for high-quality paired image translation.

**Generator: U-Net Architecture**
```
Encoder: Conv → BN → LeakyReLU (downsampling)
Decoder: ConvTranspose → BN → ReLU (upsampling)
Skip connections: Concatenate encoder and decoder features
```

**Discriminator: PatchGAN**
- Classifies image patches rather than entire image
- Receptive field size determines patch scale
- Multiple discriminators for multi-scale analysis

5.2 Loss Functions
-----------------
**Total Loss:**
L_total = L_cGAN + λ·L_L1

**L1 Loss:**
L_L1(G) = E_x,y,z[||y - G(x,z)||₁]

**Benefits of L1 Loss:**
- Reduces blurriness compared to L2
- Encourages sharp, high-frequency details
- Provides pixel-level supervision

5.3 PatchGAN Discriminator
-------------------------
Instead of classifying entire image, PatchGAN classifies NxN patches:

**Architecture:**
```
C64-C128-C256-C512 (Ck = Convolution-BatchNorm-LeakyReLU with k filters)
```

**Receptive Field Calculation:**
For N×N patches, discriminator has receptive field covering N×N region in input image.

**Advantages:**
- Focuses on local texture and style
- Fewer parameters than full-image discriminator
- Can be applied to images of varying sizes

================================================================================
6. CYCLEGAN AND UNPAIRED TRANSLATION
================================================================================

6.1 CycleGAN Motivation and Approach
------------------------------------
CycleGAN enables unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle consistency constraint.

**Key Insight:** If we translate image from domain X to Y, then translate back to X, we should recover the original image.

**Dual Mapping:**
- G: X → Y (forward mapping)
- F: Y → X (backward mapping)

6.2 Cycle Consistency Loss
--------------------------
**Forward Cycle Consistency:**
L_cyc(G,F) = E_x~p_data(x)[||F(G(x)) - x||₁]

**Backward Cycle Consistency:**
L_cyc(F,G) = E_y~p_data(y)[||G(F(y)) - y||₁]

**Total Cycle Loss:**
L_cyc = L_cyc(G,F) + L_cyc(F,G)

6.3 Complete CycleGAN Objective
------------------------------
**Full Objective:**
L(G,F,D_X,D_Y) = L_GAN(G,D_Y,X,Y) + L_GAN(F,D_X,Y,X) + λ·L_cyc(G,F)

Where:
- L_GAN: Adversarial loss for each direction
- λ: Controls relative importance of cycle consistency
- Typically λ = 10

**Training Process:**
1. Train G to fool D_Y while satisfying cycle consistency
2. Train F to fool D_X while satisfying cycle consistency  
3. Train D_Y to distinguish real Y from G(x)
4. Train D_X to distinguish real X from F(y)

6.4 Architecture Details
-----------------------
**Generator:** ResNet-based architecture
```
3×Conv(down-sampling) → 6×ResBlock → 3×ConvTranspose(up-sampling)
```

**Discriminator:** PatchGAN (same as Pix2Pix)

**Instance Normalization:** Used instead of batch normalization for better style transfer

================================================================================
7. ADVANCED STYLE TRANSFER TECHNIQUES
================================================================================

7.1 Fast Neural Style Transfer
------------------------------
**Problem with Original NST:** Slow optimization (requires hundreds of iterations per image)

**Solution:** Train feed-forward network to directly transform images

**Architecture:**
```
Input Image → Transformation Network → Stylized Output
```

**Training Process:**
1. Train transformation network T_θ on content images
2. Use pre-trained VGG for loss computation
3. Loss = α·L_content + β·L_style + γ·L_tv

**Total Variation Loss (Spatial Smoothness):**
L_tv = ∑ᵢⱼ [(xᵢ,ⱼ₊₁ - xᵢⱼ)² + (xᵢ₊₁,ⱼ - xᵢⱼ)²]

7.2 Arbitrary Style Transfer
----------------------------
**Limitation of Fast NST:** One network per style

**Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN):**
AdaIN(x, y) = σ(y) · ((x - μ(x))/σ(x)) + μ(y)

Where:
- x: Content features
- y: Style features  
- μ, σ: Channel-wise mean and standard deviation

**WCT (Whitening and Coloring Transform):**
1. Whiten content features: fc = Ec⁻¹/²(f - μc)
2. Color with style statistics: fcs = Es¹/²fc + μs

7.3 Photorealistic Style Transfer
---------------------------------
**Challenge:** Maintaining photorealism while transferring style

**Approach:** Constrain stylization to semantically similar regions

**Segmentation-based Transfer:**
1. Segment both content and style images
2. Transfer style only between matching semantic regions
3. Use closedform matting for smooth transitions

**Deep Photo Style Transfer:**
- Add photorealism regularization
- Local affine transformation in luminance
- Preserve semantic segmentation boundaries

================================================================================
8. EVALUATION METRICS AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

8.1 Quantitative Metrics
------------------------
**Inception Score (IS):**
IS = exp(E_x[KL(p(y|x)||p(y))])

Where p(y|x) is conditional label distribution from Inception network.

**Fréchet Inception Distance (FID):**
FID = ||μ_r - μ_g||² + Tr(Σ_r + Σ_g - 2(Σ_r Σ_g)^(1/2))

Where μ, Σ are mean and covariance of Inception features for real (r) and generated (g) images.

**LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity):**
Measures perceptual distance using deep features:
d(x,x₀) = ∑_l (1/H_l W_l) ∑_{h,w} ||w_l ⊙ (ŷ_hw^l - ŷ₀_hw^l)||²₂

8.2 Content Preservation Metrics
-------------------------------
**Feature-based Content Loss:**
Measure distance between deep features of original and stylized images.

**Structural Similarity (SSIM):**
SSIM(x,y) = (2μ_x μ_y + c₁)(2σ_xy + c₂) / ((μ_x² + μ_y² + c₁)(σ_x² + σ_y² + c₂))

8.3 Style Transfer Quality
--------------------------
**Gram Matrix Distance:**
Compare Gram matrices between style image and result.

**Neural Histogram Matching:**
Measure style similarity using feature distribution matching.
