1. LINEAR CODES AND ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURE
=======================================

1.1 Linear Block Codes:
----------------------
[n,k,d] linear code C over finite field F_q:
- n: block length (codeword length)
- k: dimension (information symbols)
- d: minimum distance

Codeword: c = mG where m is message, G is generator matrix
Parity check: Hc^T = 0 where H is parity-check matrix

Rate: R = k/n (information rate)
Redundancy: n - k (parity symbols)

1.2 Generator and Parity-Check Matrices:
---------------------------------------
Generator matrix G ∈ F_q^{k×n}, rank(G) = k
Systematic form: G = [I_k | P] where I_k is identity

Parity-check matrix H ∈ F_q^{(n-k)×n}, rank(H) = n-k
Relationship: GH^T = 0

Standard form: H = [-P^T | I_{n-k}]

1.3 Syndrome Decoding:
---------------------
Received vector: r = c + e (c: codeword, e: error)
Syndrome: s = Hr^T = He^T

Syndrome depends only on error pattern
Coset decomposition: F_q^n = ∪_i (C + e_i)

Syndrome table: Map syndromes to error patterns
Complexity: 2^{n-k} syndromes to store

1.5 Weight Enumerator:
---------------------
A(w) = number of codewords of weight w

2. CYCLIC CODES AND POLYNOMIAL METHODS
======================================

2.1 Cyclic Codes Definition:
---------------------------
Linear code C is cyclic if:
(c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}) ∈ C ⟹ (c_{n-1}, c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-2}) ∈ C

Polynomial representation:
c(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + ... + c_{n-1} x^{n-1}

Cyclic shift: x·c(x) mod (x^n - 1)

2.2 Generator Polynomial:

Meggitt decoding: Syndrome-based cyclic decoding
Error trapping: Detect correctable error patterns

2.5 Dual of Cyclic Codes:
------------------------
If g(x) generates C, then h(x) = (x^n - 1)/g(x) generates C^⊥

Reciprocal polynomial: g^*(x) = x^{deg(g)} g(1/x)
Dual generator: h(x) = x^{n-k} g^*(x) / g^*(0)

=======================================================

3. REED-SOLOMON AND BCH CODES
